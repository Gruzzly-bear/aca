<h3 id="toc0"><span>Special Containment Procedures</span></h3>
<p>SCP-8867 is currently uncontained. All of SCP-8867's activities are monitored by fujo.aic; any posts containing potentially sensitive information are to be flagged and Foundation staff are to be alerted.</p>
<p>In the event of a data breach that could affect the integrity of the Veil, targeted misinformation is to be disseminated to enforce the idea that all content produced by SCP-8867 is its original creation and bears no relation to real Foundation activities.</p>
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Description</span></h3>
<p>SCP-8867 is the collective designation for a pair of social media accounts on the sites Twitter and Archive of our Own, both of which use the handle "ShipCutePairs". Attempts to identify the individual operating these accounts have been unsuccessful, as have attempts made to delete or disable said accounts.</p>
<p>Content posted by SCP-8867 consists of RPF, or “real person fiction”,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> depicting a romantic and sexual relationship between Foundation employees Vincent Smith and Chris Wesson. However, SCP-8867 describes the content it produces as “oc”, (or "original content"), and claims that both the affected employees and the Foundation are their own fictional creations. Followers of SCP-8867 accounts believe its activities to be entirely non-anomalous.</p>
<p>The specific narrative details of material posted by SCP-8867 vary, but all depict some level of erotic content, with plots typically consisting of "slice of life"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> or "PWP"<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> style stories. SCP-8867 displays accurate knowledge of events and personal details of the persons included within these stories, and often incorporates these details in its posts.</p>
<hr/>
<h4 id="toc2"><span>Addendum One: Initial Discovery</span></h4>
<p>Foundation personnel first became aware of SCP-8867 on 14/2/25, when a Foundation webcrawler flagged a Twitter post belonging to SCP-8867 as potentially sensitive.<br/>

Upon reviewing the linked page, concerns were raised about a potential anomaly, but due to the nature of the page’s content, the prevailing theory was that the account belonged to a Foundation employee. After some discussion, Agent Smith and Dr. Wesson were called in to discuss their connection to the anomaly.

<p>New series I’ve been thinking of for a while! Going to be mostly just one-shots of this pair set in this universe, I’ll see how the story develops ♥️. Don't expect a deep plot tho, I'm really just here to write some good old fashioned guy-on-guy action lol<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
It seemed the nature of their schedules that as Wesson’s grew fuller, Smith’s emptied. It made sense- Wesson and his part of the team had to do all the careful reconnaissance and intel gathering Smith needed to go in guns blazing with his part, so until that was complete, there wasn’t much for the agent to do.</p>
<p>But with the current mission being in the early stages of planning, Wesson was exhausted by the time he slipped into Smith’s Foundation quarters, grey eyes glazing over behind wire-rimmed glasses. He closed the door softly behind him, not bothering to knock or announce his presence. He knew Smith was expecting him.</p>
<p>Smith had been using his free time productively- it was clear he had been practicing at the firing range, as he now sat at his desk, carefully stripping down and cleaning his rifle. Wesson's eyes clung to the way those deft, strong fingers caressed the barrel, stroking up and down the hard rod, oiling it up. He lubed up the cleaning brush, plunging in into the tight entrance of the barrel, pumping it in hard, deft, strokes. Wesson swallowed thickly, heat pooling in his stomach.</p>
<p>“You going to stand there watching me all day?” Smith growled in a deep baritone, a smirk tugging at his lips.</p>
<p>“Depends,” Wesson countered, “is that a Glock in your pants, or are you just happy to see me?” He leaned against the door, arms crossed, trying to ignore the way his own slacks started to tent.</p>
<p>Smith stood, and Wesson drunk in the way his tank top clung to the plump curves of his pecs and hard planes of his abs. He crossed the space between them in a few deliberate strides, one strong hand gripping the doctor’s hip and pulling him closer.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you find out?”</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 19/2/25</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Site-55 HR Director David Callahan</p>
<p><strong>Interviewees:</strong> MTF Delta-5 Agents Vincent Smith &amp; Dr. Chris Wesson</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-8867's Discovery</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Smith and Wesson enter the room, and take a seat across from Callahan’s desk. Callahan clears his throat and opens a folder on his desk, retrieving two sheets of paper and placing them face down on the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Thank you for meeting with me today, gentlemen. I’ll cut right to the chase. We’ve been alerted to some, uh, writings, that may constitute a data breach. The … contents of this breach concern you two.</p>
<p><em>Callahan slides the pieces of paper across the desk. The pages are hard copies of SCP-8867’s initial tweet and excerpt one.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> I think it would be easiest to explain if you just read these.</p>
<p><em>Smith and Wesson are silent for approximately the next five minutes as they read and process the information. Callahan appears to be re-organising his folder as they read, shuffling paper with his eyes downcast.</em></p>
<p><em>Wesson's frown becomes more pronounced as he reads, and he looks between the paper and Callahan rapidly. Smith does not visibly react, but continues to stare at the paper as conversation resumes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> I understand this is probably a lot —</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> What the fuck?</p>
<p><em>Wesson slams the paper onto the desk, causing it to rattle. Callahan recoils slightly. Smith does not react.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> No, I mean seriously. What the hell is this? Where is this from — <em>who wrote this?</em></p>
<p><em>Wesson leans forwards, sitting on the edge of his chair as he balls his hands into fists. His brow is furrowed. Callahan avoids eye contact as he retrieves the paper.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> That’s what we’re currently trying to figure out. I wanted to ask if either of you had any connection to the creation of this article.</p>
<p><em>Wesson stands from his chair abruptly. Smith looks up from his paper, eyes flicking from Wesson to Callahan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> You think <em>we</em> did this? You’re saying one of us wrote this?</p>
<p><em>Callahan holds his hand up in a pacifying gesture, shaking his head.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> No, no, nothing like that. Please, sit down.</p>
<p><em>He waits for Wesson to return to his seat. After a short pause, he does.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> We just wanted to ask if either of you had any information related to this, or insight into who could have created it. We’ve opened an investigation —</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Does this count as slander?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> … Whatever this can be qualified as, it’s certainly inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong><em>(Scoffs)</em> That’s an understatement. This is … I don't even know <em>what</em> I'm supposed to call this. An attack on our reputations, maybe.</p>
<p><em>Silence for approximately 30 seconds. Wesson removes his glasses and rubs his face rapidly.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Well, was there anything else? Or can we go?</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> You’re taking these posts down, right?</p>
<p><em>Wesson stops his movements, his focus snapping to Smith. Callahan nods, sighing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> That is one of our priorities, yes. And if you don’t have anything else to add, then yes, you may leave.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Well. I hope you figure this out soon.</p>
<p><em>The two men stand, and begin to exit the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> <em>(Quietly)</em> Old man yaoi? I’m 36.</p>
<p><em>The door closes behind them.</em></p>

<h4 id="toc4"><span>Addendum Two: Containment Attempts</span></h4>
<p>Foundation Cybersecurity personnel began attempts to trace the user of SCP-8867's accounts following the initial discovery. Attempts at IP tracing were unsuccessful, with the associated IPs changing frequently. Attempts at determining the account's ISP (Internet Service Provider) were also unsuccessful, with no records of the user being found on any major databases.</p>
<p>Failing to locate a user, Foundation personnel embedded within Twitter moderation staff issued a ban to SCP-8867’s account, causing the account to go offline for approximately one hour. It subsequently reappeared on the site under the same handle, with no alteration or deletion of its contents.</p>

<p>Agent Smith finds the long, slow hours of reconnaissance missions terribly boring. Luckily, he’s got Dr. Wesson to make the task more enjoyable.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="font-size:1.2em;"><span style='font-family: "Noto Serif", serif;'>Notes:</span></span></p>
<hr/>
<p>Just some shameless smut! The only reason I write about these two doing actual special agent things is so they can get freaky on the job lol. Shoutout to the commenter who wanted to see Wesson whimpering and begging, this one's for you.<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Agent Smith’s least favourite part of reconnaissance missions was the paperwork, so he was more than happy to pass off that duty to his partner, Dr. Wesson. He watched as Wesson leafed through the report form, chewing his pen as he scribbled down notes. It was honestly only the fact that he was with Wesson that made reconnaissance bearable - he found himself deeply bored by the sitting and waiting the job sometimes required.</p>
<p>He sipped his coffee, watching as Wesson closed his folder, patted his breast pocket, and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. He was so fixated on watching the way his lips curled around the stick, that he almost didn’t snatch it from him before he could light it. Almost.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Wesson protested, scowling. Smith flicked the cigarette back at him with a grin. “Don’t smoke in the car. You’ll stink it up.”</p>
<p>“Air filters would’ve taken care of it.” Wesson mumbled, rolling his eyes, but shoved the packet back in his pocket anyway. Smith smirked, eyeing the way the sleek kevlar body armour clung to his toned, muscular frame. He might not spend as much time in the field as Smith, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at him.</p>
<p>“If you need something in your mouth that badly, I’m sure I can find something else for you.” He suggested, making himself comfortable in his seat and spreading his legs slightly. Wesson’s eyes immediately dropped to his lap, lips parting slightly in a sharp inhale. “We’re on duty.” He said, without much conviction.</p>
<p>“We were. Din’t you just finish the paperwork? Plus, the windows are tinted.” Smith fingered his zipper, slowly tugging it down.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Smith and Wesson enter Callahan’s office. Wesson is visibly agitated; Smith is frowning slightly. The two men sit at the desk as Callahan opens the folder and retrieves hard copies of excerpt two.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Gentlemen, thank you for joining me again. I wanted to update you both on our investigation into SCP-8867.</p>
<p><em>He slides them the documents.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> We have reason to believe —</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> We’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> We’ve already seen the post. What have you been doing to take down the account?</p>
<p><em>He leans forwards in his chair as his shoulders tense. Callahan presses his lips together in a slight frown.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> I’m not sure if it’s a good idea for you to be interacting with the account.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> I’m not interacting with it, I just wanted to know what kind of filth is being posted about me behind my back. I have a right to know. Did you find out who it is yet?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> … We don’t believe the accounts are being run by anyone within the Foundation. Due to unusual difficulties with disabling the accounts, combined with the level of knowledge displayed within the … posts, we believe the accounts are anomalous in nature.</p>
<p><em>Wesson slumps back in his chair, running a hand through his hair. Smith straightens up slightly, his jaw clenching.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> … You’re joking. You, I mean, it could still be someone here. Other Delta-5 members would know where we were on that day, it’s —</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> <em>(Quietly)</em> They knew we got coffee. That wasn’t in the after-mission report.</p>
<p><em>As he speaks, Smith places a hand on Wesson’s shoulder, who recoils at the touch. Smith quickly retracts his hand, putting it in his pocket. All occupants of the room are silent for approximately 10 seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Well, everyone gets coffee on recon. It's just a lucky guess. Look, I’m just saying you shouldn’t rule out that it’s someone here fucking with us, ok?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> We’re continuing our efforts to identify the owner of SCP-8867, as well as remove it. Luckily, the accounts don’t appear to be a threat to the Veil, so —</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Yeah, that’s great and all, but what about us? Our reputations? It’s … it’s defamation of character, is what it is.</p>
<p><em>Smith shifts slightly in his chair. He opens his mouth as if to speak, and then closes it again.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> There’s already been enough unprofessional rumours. I don’t want to have to deal with this as well.</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Rest assured, we’re doing all that we can to resolve this issue. In the meantime, try not to let this affect you. Just ignore the accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> <em>(Under his breath)</em> Easy for you to say.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Is that all you needed from us today, Director?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Yes, thank you. I’ll keep you two in the loop as this progresses, but in the meantime, just try and take your mind off it.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Smith and Wesson worked together like a well oiled machine in everything they did, both on and off the field. But they had been falling out of sync recently. Smith knew when Wesson was stressed, even when he tried to hide it. He could read the tightness in his shoulders and the pinch of his lips like an open book, and written all over that book was a need to relax.</p>
<p>Smith knew he couldn’t trust Wesson to take a break if left to his own devices, so he let himself into his room. The space was much more cluttered than his own, books and papers piled high over his desk, where the doctor sat hunched, muttering, grey orbs fixed on the pages.</p>
<p>“Hey.” Smith said, coming up behind him to begin massaging his shoulders with large, warm hands. Despite the calluses from all his field work, they were gentle as they worked out the knots in the muscles. “Take a break.”</p>
<p>“Busy.” Wesson mumbled, but he sighed with relief at the treatment, closing his eyes to focus on the feeling. Smiths hands slipped over his front, loosening his tie and slipping lower to brush over perky nipples hardening beneath his dress shirt.</p>
<p><em>Extraneous material removed for irrelevance to context.</em></p>
<p>Wesson moaned as Smith bit and sucked dark kisses into his inner thigh, stubble prickling tender skin. He traced the tattoo there with his tongue, the one of a snake that curled over his thigh to finish at the curve of his hipbone, the one he loved to run his fingers over when they were alone. Black and red ink contrasted with purple bruises.</p>

<p>Dear Director Callahan,</p>
<p>I wanted to check in with how the attempts to contain SCP-8867 are progressing. I now believe it’s an anomaly. That last post had information no one here should know about (I have a tattoo matching the description in the story).</p>
<p>Which is why I’m so concerned; although the events within these stories are fiction, SCP-8867 has intimate knowledge that it shouldn’t have access to, and it's sharing that to the public.</p>
<p>Please get back to me ASAP.</p>

<p>Director Callahan,</p>
Any updates on containment? The accounts are still active and posting last time I checked. Asked around, but I haven’t heard back from anyone in Cybersecurity about it. Also, I’ve seen the file. Can you remove the account's username? I think some people have been looking up the account. I swear I’ve walked in on my coworkers discussing it, because they stop talking when I enter the room. People have stopped looking me in the eye.</div>

<p><strong>Interview Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 19/3/25</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Site-55 HR Director David Callahan</p>
<p><strong>Interviewees:</strong> MTF Delta-5 Agents Vincent Smith &amp; Dr. Chris Wesson</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> SCP-8867's Containment Hiatus</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Smith and Wesson seat themselves quickly. Wesson crosses his arms as one leg bounces up and down rapidly. Smith glances at him with concern before turning his attention on Callahan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Good —</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Why’s the containment on hiatus?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> I was going to explain that. Unfortunately, none of our efforts to contain SCP-8867 have been successful, and we’ve exhausted the options we have at our disposal. Containment professionals have determined that information shared by the accounts doesn't risk compromising Foundation information security, so containment is a low priority.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> But … it mentions the Foundation. By name.</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> We've been monitoring the interactions with the account. All civilians who've engaged with the content believe it to be entirely fictional.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> What about people who know about the Foundation?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> People or groups of interest, they know the Foundation’s real. We’re in the middle of something important right now — what about the information related to Operation Dead Letter?</p>
<p><em>Wesson sits up straighter, nodding. Callahan pages through his folder, tapping the file with his finger.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> While it may vaguely mention your duties in passing, there are no specific locations, dates, or names within these stories. All an outsider would be able to discern from this is that you are field agents. And any potential threats to the Foundation are already very aware of our armed forces.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> <em>(Muttering)</em> It has <em>our</em> names in it.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Well, there has to be something else you can try, right?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> <em>(Sighing)</em> I understand your frustration, but we can’t afford to allocate unlimited resources to a low risk case. We have a lot of important issues that require Cybersecurity's attention. We’ll continue to monitor it in case the situation evolves, though.</p>
<p><em>Wesson is silent, brow furrowed. Smith glances at him, frowning.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> So that’s all you can do?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Unfortunately, yes. The risk that further action poses to the Veil greatly outweighs the benefits.</p>
<p><em>Wesson stands abruptly. Smith rises to follow him.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> I see how it is.</p>
<p><em>Wesson moves swiftly for the exit, followed by Smith.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Thank you for your —</p>
<p><em>The door slams.</em></p>

Wesson tensed his muscles, flexing his shoulders as he tested the ropes binding his hands behind his back for give. Finding none, he smiled. <em>It’s aways nice to see people use the things you teach them.</em></p>
<p>“Eyes on me.” Smith's voice is low and gravelly. He looked down at Wesson, his dark eyes steely and full of desire. “I’ll ask you again, Agent - who do you work for?”</p>
<p>Wesson grinned, his own lust springing to life. “You’ll have to do better than that to get an answer out of me.” He purred, tugging at his restraints performatively.</p>
<p>Smith leaned in, running a seductive hand through Wesson's dark hair, only to grab a fistful and tug his head back gently. “You’ll find we have ways of making you talk.” He promised, other hand beginning to unbutton Wesson's shirt.</p>

<p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> 26/3/25<br/>
<strong>Time of Incident:</strong> 15:20<br/>
<strong>Location of Incident:</strong> Room 1AC-23<br/>
<strong>Involved parties:</strong> Agent Tom Mitchell</p>
<p><strong>Nature of discrimination:</strong></p>

▣ Other</p>
<p><strong>Please describe the incident in detail:</strong></p>
<p>During the rappelling drill, Agent Mitchell made a comment about how it “makes sense they’d get Wesson to run this, since he has experience with knots.” He specifically waited to make this comment until I was within earshot. I believe he was referring to the most recent SCP-8867 instance.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe how the incident in question has affected your ability to perform your job:</strong></p>
<p>My co-workers reading pornographic and slanderous material involving me undermines my status as a professional.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe any solutions you believe would help resolve this issue:</strong></p>
<p>Remove any identifiable information from the SCP-8867 document and reprimand those who seek it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Dear Dr. Wesson,</p>
<p>We understand that being associated with SCP-8867 must be frustrating, but based on the information you have provided, we cannot conclusively state that Agent Mitchell was acting in a manner that constitutes harassment.</p>

<p><strong>Please describe the incident in detail:</strong></p>
<p>During lunch break, when I entered the cafeteria, Agent Mitchell was showing something on his phone to several other Delta-5 agents (listed above) and laughing. When I approached, he quickly turned off his phone. I asked about what he was looking at, and he said it was "nothing important". I’m certain it was SCP-8867. You can ask the other agents.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe how the incident in question has affected your ability to perform your job:</strong></p>
<p>Having my team's respect is important to be able to properly communicate with them.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe any solutions you believe would help resolve this issue:</strong></p>
<p>Some form of disciplinary action needs to be taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Dear Dr. Wesson,</p>
<p>We have followed up on your complaint with the employees listed in your statement, and they have confirmed that they were not viewing SCP-8867 during this incident.</p>
<p>It is my personal recommendation that you try to disengage from SCP-8867 related matters, as it seems to be affecting you negatively. Your co-workers are professionals. They are able to separate their perception of you from the events depicted by the anomaly, and your anxiety related to SCP-8867 may be affecting your judgement of them. I would recommend you speak to a Foundation counselor about how this stress may be affecting you.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br/>

<p><strong>Please describe the incident in detail:</strong></p>
<p>They're ignoring me when I talk to them, and when I confront them they say they just didn't hear me. If I'm near Smith, they'll start smirking and muttering to each other. I swear I saw Mitchell take a picture. I don't know what they're saying about me, but it's spreading. I went to talk to Dr. Gideon in Procurement to get some files I needed, and he acted like I was diseased or something, and if he spoke to me for too long he would catch it too. I can't even eat around them anymore. Learned my lesson after I tried eating a banana in the break room. Don't want to repeat what was said. You can imagine it.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe how the incident in question has affected your ability to perform your job:</strong></p>
<p>I’m being treated like a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Please describe any solutions you believe would help resolve this issue:</strong></p>
<p>Just do something to stop this.</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Dr. Wesson,</p>
<p>I would again advise you to reach out to someone to manage this fixation you have on SCP-8867. It's clear you're allowing this preoccupation with the anomaly to impact your performance. Please take steps to manage this before we have to intervene.</p>
<p>You've raised the issue several times, and we have investigated the matter and found no evidence of misconduct. Continuing to press this matter without verifiable evidence can be considered misuse of Foundation resources.</p>
<p>You should also consider how your actions reflect on you. The way you conduct your relationship with Smith may be placing you in a subordinate light in the eyes of your peers.</p>

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Wesson doesn’t acknowledge Smith as he enters his room, keeping his eyes stubbornly locked on his laptop. Maybe if he ignores him, he’ll go away. He doesn’t. Smith stands in front of his desk, arms crossed.</p>
<p>“So, were you going to tell me you requested reassignment, or were you just planning on letting me find out from Communications Operations?” Smith's disappointment is palpable in his voice.</p>
<p>Wesson grits his teeth, gaze fixed on his screen, typing like he’s trying to stab through the keyboard.</p>
<p>“You’re avoiding me.” Wesson rolls his eyes at that, with a short, humourless bark of laughter. “No shit.” He answers back sharply. “Are you <em>trying</em> to feed the rumours about us?” He finally closes his laptop with a snap, standing from his chair to glare at Smith. He just stares back, face unreadable.</p>
<p>“Acting like this is only going to make things worse.” Smith answers levelly. “You’re the one feeding into them. Just act like it doesn’t bother you. Ignore them, and they’ll stop.”</p>
<p>Wesson scoffs. “Sure. I’m sure that’ll work.” He steps around the desk and his partner, walking towards the door. “Why did you come here? What if someone saw you come in? They’ll probably start telling everyone on Site you were bending me over my desk.”</p>
<p>A slight smirk tugs at the corner of Smith’s solemn look. “Would you like me to?” Wesson stops mid stride and spins around, stalking towards him with indignation. He doesn’t know if he wants to kiss or slap him. “Can you take this seriously?” He hisses.</p>
<p>“I am.” Smith replies levelly. “If you keep making a big deal about this, people will wonder why you care so much. Start thinking there's some truth to the rumours. Just say nothing, and act normal.”</p>
<p>Wesson can feel the burning mortification in his cheeks, crossing his arms and narrowing his eyes. “Easy for you to say. It's different for you." Smith raises an eyebrow. "How is it any different?" he challenges.</p>
<p>"You’re not the one getting <em>fucked.</em>" Wesson snarls. "You're not the one they're saying loves to get on his knees, who lies down and takes it like a bitch.” Shame pools hot in his stomach. He feels so pathetic, so much smaller than Smith, despite standing eye-to-eye with his partner.</p>
<p>Smith stands there impassively for a second, and then makes a move for the door. “I should go.” He says, and Wesson grabs his wrist, spinning him around.</p>
<p>“Don’t you fucking dare.” He snarls, and pulls him into a frantic, open-mouthed kiss, both of them grabbing and tugging at each other's clothes, panting and desperate.</p>

<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Smith is seated at a table with some members of Delta-5. He picks at his meal. Mitchell approaches the table, sitting down next to Smith, the rest of Delta-5 congregating as they receive their food. Mitchell scans the room, appearing to look for something, then turns to Smith.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Where's Wesson? Haven't seen him around here for a while.</p>
<p><em>Smith shrugs.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Hell if I know. Why'd you ask me, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> I figured if anyone would know it'd be you. Y'know, since you two are so… close.</p>
<p><em>A few members of the table snort. They turn their focus away from their own conversations and towards Smith.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Just that you guys spend a lot of time together.</p>
<p><em>Smith grunts non-committally. He does not look at Mitchell, instead focusing on his food.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> I'm kinda surprised you're not with him right now, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Why'd you even care about this?</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Damn, I'm just tryna make some conversation! Thought I'd try and be supportive, since I heard about that little anomaly problem you’re dealing with.</p>
<p><em>There’s scattered laughter from the surrounding agents. Smith freezes for a second, then looks over at Mitchell.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Oh yeah? And why have you been looking into it? You better not be using me as jerk-off material.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> You wish. I mean, it’s not really a surprise. Whole site's known for a while that you and Wesson have a thing for each other.</p>
<p><em>Smith's grip tightens on his fork, and he turns away from Mitchell, going back to picking at his food.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> We’re coworkers.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Sure, sure. <em>Coworkers.</em></p>
<p><em>Mitchell makes an obscene hand gesture, mimicking penetration. The other occupants of the table begin laughing. Smith ignores Mitchell, continuing to eat.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> So which one of you takes it up the ass, eh? I’d kind of suspected it, but I didn’t think you two were <em>actually</em> fag-</p>
<p><em>Smith turns and punches Mitchell in the jaw, who recoils, almost falling off the bench before catching himself and lunging at Smith. The pair fall to the ground, trading blows, while the other agents attempt to separate them, yelling. After around a minute of this, the other agents manage to get a hold on the pair, pulling them away from each other and restraining them.</em></p>
<p><em>Mitchell glares at Smith, and spits a wad of blood onto the floor.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> Jesus. Can’t take a fucking joke.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Log Transcript</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 30/4/25</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Site-55 HR Director David Callahan</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> MTF Delta-5 Agent Vincent Smith</p>
<p><strong>Subject:</strong> Misconduct Report</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><em>Agent Smith sits slouched in his chair, arms crossed. His face is visibly bruised, and his lip is split.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Agent Smith. It’s disappointing that we have to have this meeting.</p>
<p><em>Smith doesn’t respond.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> It’s extremely disappointing, actually. For such an agent of your caliber, you should have more self-control than this. What were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Was I supposed to let him get away with saying that shit to me?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> Language. And "he started it" is not an acceptable argument at your age, Smith. You can’t just escalate to physical violence because someone said something you didn’t like.</p>
<p><em>Smith is silent again. Callahan sighs, flipping through his folder.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> You’re being placed on a probationary period until Operation Dead Letter concludes. If, during this time, you can stop letting SCP-8867 upset you and act like the professional you are, we can leave this incident in the past, where it belongs. Otherwise, you're looking at a rank demotion.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> And Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> What about Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> <em>(Sarcastically)</em> What d’you think I mean, "about Mitchell?"</p>
<p><em>Smith gestures at his face with a sarcastic smile, then winces slightly as the expression pulls at the split in his lip.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> We’ll be speaking to him as well.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> He's been talking about Wesson-</p>
<p><strong>Callahan:</strong> I would <em>also</em> suggest that you spend less time focused on Wesson, and more time focused on your duties. While we don't strictly disallow relationships, this could fall under fraternization. And believe me, that's a much more serious matter than your little lunchroom brawl.</p>
<p><em>Callahan's lip curls slightly. Smith tenses. His hands are balled in his lap, and his knuckles begin to turn white.</em></p>
<p><strong>Callahan</strong>: I'll be making a note of this infraction on your record. You are dismissed.</p>

<p>A loose sequel to Behind my Back. I promised they’d get better! Now hopefully they do the right thing ;) No spoilers though!<br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span><br/>
Smith winced, flinching away as Wesson gently pressed the cotton ball to his lip. The sharp sting of rubbing alcohol echoed the sting of humiliation and hurt that still pricked at him, no matter how hard he tried to ignore it.</p>
<p>But that sting is nothing compared to the scalding stab of Wessons gaze, studying him with disapproval and heavy with things left unsaid.</p>
<p>”Hold still.” He murmured, one hand cupping Smith’s jaw, fingers tracing the flutter of his pulse.</p>
<p>“I’m trying.” Smith replied, trying to look anywhere but him. It was no easy feat.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you be used to this? Getting beaten up is sort of your job. Why are you so jumpy?” Wesson reprimanded. This made him laugh, which caused another disapproving glare as the motion again jerked his face away from Wesson’s grasp.</p>
<p><em>Because you’re the one doing it.</em> He thought, but instead, replied with, “Actually, my job is to be the one doing the beating.”</p>
<p>Wesson rolled his eyes, and continued to dab at the cut. The pair were quiet as the silence stretched out, laden with painful expectations. Smith was the one who broke it first. “I thought you'd be happy about it. You're the one who didn't want me to ignore them.”</p>
<p>Wesson frowned. "Don't make this about me. I don't need you to fight my battles for me." He dabbed at the cut harder than was strictly necessary. "Just what I wanted, my big strong hero swooping in to save his boytoy." His voiced dripped with bitter sarcasm.</p>
<p>Smith considered giving another flippant response, trying to deflect and shrug the incident off, but no. Wesson deserved his honesty, even if it hurt to give it. “It wasn't like that. I just … snapped.” His voice was quiet, gravelly. “I was going to keep ignoring him, but then the next thing I knew, I was on top of him and his nose was broken.”</p>
<p>Wesson chewed his lip, quiet as he packed away the first aid kit. Smith wished he could know what he was thinking, what hid behind those stormy eyes and pretty face. “You’re right.” Smith murmured.</p>
<p>Wesson's eyes snapped to him, clean up frozen in its tracks.</p>
<p>“What they say gets to me too. It was just … easier for me to ignore it. Until it wasn't.” Smith studied his hands where they sat curled loosely in his lap, the violence painted on them in dark bruises. “You’re braver than me.” The words stuck in his throat.</p>
<p>Lithe hands covered his own, soft where his were hard from rifle stocks and knife handles. “I wish you’d talk to me.” Wessons voice was gentle, but sad, and anger still tinged it at the edges. “You’re supposed to have my back. But now, the second we’re off the field, you disappear.” The accusation stung, mostly because it was true.</p>
<p>He entwined their fingers, finally dragging his gaze up to match Wesson’s. “I’m sorry.” Those two words took more from him than an entire day out in the field, but they were worth more than any mission he’d ever run.</p>
<p>He knew he’d been forgiven when Wesson closed the gap between them with a kiss.</p>
<p><em>Extraneous material removed for irrelevance to providing context.</em></p>
<p>Wesson lay next to Smith in exhausted bliss, eyes closed. His breath slow and even, he was content to simply listen to the steady rhythm of Smith’s heartbeat.</p>
<p>“You’re right.” At the sound of Smith's voice, he opened his eyes, propping himself up on his elbow to get a better look at his partner.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it.” His voice was decisive.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Hope laced Wesson’s words as he spoke. He had hoped but hadn't dared believe his partner would come around to the idea.</p>
<p>In response, Smith pulls him closer, wrapping his arms around him in a comforting embrace. It’s the only answer he needs to give.</p>

<p><em>Smith and Wesson are sitting at a table in the break room, drinking from paper cups of coffee. Both agents have a large black duffel bag sitting by their feet, and are in dressed in plainclothes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Are you sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Nah. But I’ve never really been sure about anything.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> <em>(Sharp laugh)</em> That's reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Except you.</p>
<p><em>Wesson punches him in the shoulder. Smith laughs and rubs his arm in mock pain.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Don’t start getting soft on me.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Shut up and let me be genuine for a second, ok? I thought that's what you wanted.</p>
<p><em>Smith sighs, taking a sip from his cup, looking down at it in apparent reflection.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> As long as I’ve got you, whatever choice we make will be the right one. It’s corny, yeah, but it’s true.</p>
<p><em>Wesson is quiet for a moment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Feels like I gave so much of myself to this place.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Yeah. Me too.</p>
<p><em>The pair sit in silence for around 10 seconds</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> What a waste, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> You were the best at it.</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> <em>(Laughs)</em> So were you. And we’ll find something else to be the best at.</p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> <em>(Sighing)</em> Looking back … none of it feels like it was worth what it took, you know?</p>
<p><em>Smith shakes his head with a smile.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Hey, nothing was taken. At least, nothing we can't take back.</p>
<p><em>Wesson is quiet for a moment, and then nods. He stands, and Smith stands too. Wesson laces his fingers and stretches his arms above his head, then drops them to his sides, letting out a deep breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wesson:</strong> Ok then. To better things?</p>
<p><em>He raises his cup in a toast. Smith returns the gesture, tapping their cups together.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> To better things.</p>
<p><em>Wesson looks around the room, appearing to take his surroundings. He grins.</em></p>
