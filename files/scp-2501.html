            <h1>SCP-2501</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-2501</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2501 is to be kept in Storage Vault 3-H at <a href="/secure-facility-dossier-research-site-45">Research Site-45</a>. Only personnel with special exemption keycards will be allowed to access SCP-2501. However, the use and/or misuse of SCP-2501 is still strictly prohibited, punishable up to termination. All previous documentation and research regarding SCP-2501 is to be kept on high security Foundation servers.</p>
<p>Because of the destructive potential of SCP-2501, special exemption keycards will only be granted under special authorization from the O5 council.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2501 is a mechanical gauntlet designed to be adapted to a human hand and forearm. SCP-2501 is made of an unknown lightweight material and is powered through unknown means. SCP-2501 shows no markings or numbers to give any indication of an origin or manufacturer. SCP-2501 appears to be in need of maintenance, although knowledge of repairing certain defective mechanisms is currently beyond Foundation researchers.</p>
<p>A key-operated safety switch is installed on the underside of SCP-2501, although it appears to be defective due to the key being dislocated inside the lock cylinder, thereby keeping it affixed in the position labeled with the word 'ВКЛ.'<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> There is also a slightly corroded rotary control knob located on the left side of the "wrist". This knob is locked to the furthest clockwise position and will not turn counter-clockwise. The setting labels are too worn to be decipherable, but are hypothesized to be numbers in increasing range.</p>
<p>SCP-2501's anomalous properties manifest whenever a user inserts his/her arm into the socket and engages the claw-like mechanism at the opposite end. When held in front of the user's face, SCP-2501 is able to exert an extreme amount of pressure on an object within the perspective of the user in relation to the claw-like mechanism. No upper limit on the amount of pressure SCP-2501 can exert has yet been observed. SCP-2501 is not able to perform more dexterous functions beyond rapidly opening and closing.</p>
<p>Distance from the user to an object does not affect the end result; neither does density or size of the object. The object during this process always behaves as if two invisible forces are exerting against it at opposite ends, to the point of structural failure. Using SCP-2501 on media such as fluids or gases has no effect.</p>

<p><em>To whom it may concern,</em></p>
<p><em>I represent a professional community of auctioneers, collectors, and dealers with whom I am certain you are familiar. I am approaching your organization with an item of mutual interest. Details are also included inside the case. Rest assured, this is the right place for it.</em></p>
<p><em>Understandably you have many questions. I am not able to divulge details as it would stand as a conflict of interest towards my colleagues and clients. Still, our motives for this remittance is rather pertinent. Simply put, we are strictly dealers of art and curios. And very rarely, there are items that we come across that are not inherently or obviously threatening to that integral distinction.</em></p>
<p><em>Such is the nature of this item. As valuable as it may be, we at Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd. feel that it is in our mutual benefit, meaning us as well as the SCP Foundation, that this remain in your safekeeping. We usually retain a level of impartiality for what our clients do or do not do after the closing of a sale. However, in light of a few isolated incidents regarding our clients' intentions with this particular device, and their affiliations by and large, it is safe to assume that selling said item would be a poor business decision on our part.</em></p>
<p><em>Storage also constitutes a problem, as an extreme demand for the item rather interrupts the objectives and stable business of Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd. Nobody enjoys being a teller at a bank that is under threat of robbery every waking moment. In short, keeping the item in inventory is more trouble than it's worth; exceedingly so. So for the sake of famous landmarks, monuments, certain nations, our continued enterprise, and quite possibly the sun or moon, we hand this over to persons more experienced and adept at locking things away from the world.</em></p>
<p><em>Please accept our gift, free of charge, from us to you.</em></p>
<p><em>P.S. Included is a box of La Maison du Chocolat, and a certificate of store credit in the amount of ████GBP as a further extension of our gratitude.</em></p>
<p><em>Forever Grateful,</em></p>
