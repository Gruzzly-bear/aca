<h2 id="toc0"><span><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong></span></h2>
<p>SCP-8903 is to be contained within a standard botanical containment cell at Site-██, which must be outfitted with remote climate controls. Climate controls are to include complete control over temperature, moisture, and a fire prevention system.</p>
<p>SCP-8903's containment chamber must keep a constant temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, with a ±2 degree deviation allowed. A relative humidity level of 70% must be maintained, with a ±5 percentage points deviation allowed. Note that deviation is measured in overall relative humidity of the containment cell.</p>
<p>SCP-8903 must receive a simulated rainstorm every day at a random time for exactly 8 minutes and 54 seconds. The simulated storm is to produce 127–254 mm of water. No deviations of any kind are permitted.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">A lighting system is not required for SCP-8903, and can be left in darkness.</span><br/>
As of 25/02/202█, a day-night cycle has been implemented into SCP-8903's chamber, with an unknown amount of deviation allowed. Between the hours of 06:00 and 18:00, constant light must be shone onto SCP-8903. Otherwise, no light can be presented to SCP-8903 in any capacity.</p>
<p>Any prolonged deviation of specified conditions outside of testing is to be reported to Dr. Enkei.</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span><strong>Description:</strong></span></h2>
<p>SCP-8903 resembles a bonsai tree of unknown species. No record of discovered bonsai trees match SCP-8903's description. SCP-8903 currently measures at 83 cm in height, and has a diameter of 23cm. The leaves of SCP-8903 are all 2cm in height, 3.5cm in width, and 0.2cm in depth. All other aspects of SCP-8903's physical appearance are unremarkable.</p>
<p>SCP-8903 shows a consistent growth rate, that being 1.2cm/week in height. However, this growth rate is slowed when appropriate conditions are not met. The growth rate has shown no signs of increasing, even when feeding SCP-8903 various fertilizers. This would indicate SCP-8903 being approximately 1.3 years old, although it is unknown if this growth rate has been halted before.</p>
<p>SCP-8903 is planted within a pale blue ceramic bonsai pot, with writing on the underneath reading "You are what you are." However, this writing is only visible when SCP-8903 is not under optimal conditions. Any attempt to remove SCP-8903 from its pot is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>SCP-8903's primary affects occur when optimal conditions are not met. When conditions are not met, SCP-8903 will begin to alter its surrounding area gradually. Over time, if conditions are not met, the affected area under SCP-8903's influence will begin to widen at a proportional rate of the deviation. SCP-8903 does not seem to be affected by the changes it incurs, remaining perfectly healthy, besides the rate of growth slowing.</p>
<p>It is currently unknown whether SCP-8903 has a "maximum" area of influence, however the possibility of there being <em>no</em> maximum area has halted testing of extreme deviations of optimal conditions. Any testing must be approved by Dr. Enkei.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span><strong>RECORDED ALTERATIONS:</strong></span></h2>
<p>The record of all observed alterations, the area, and the expanse of the area have been tabulated below. All deviations lasted 6 hours, unless specified otherwise.</p>

Most fauna within the affected area died within 2 hours of deviation, with bigger animals lasting up to 3 hours.

<strong>NO TESTING OF OVER WATERING SCP-8903 IS PERMITTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.</strong></td>
<td style="border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;">Due to the size of the affected area, it is currently impossible to determine damages to any organisms outside of Site-██.

<h2 id="toc3"><span><strong>ADDENDUM 8903-01:</strong></span></h2>
<p>On the 23th of February,202█, at 00:00, all light sources within a 500 meter radius from SCP-8903 ceased operation. This includes, but is not limited to: flashlights, phones, light bulbs and bio-luminescence produced by specific fauna. Moonlight and starlight was unaffected.<br/>
Site-██ was initially put under high alert, and a nearby security team located at Area-██ was deployed to the Site. At approximately 00:23, a Security operative's flashlight began to operate normally when inside SCP-8903's containment.</p>
<p>Upon shining their flashlight towards SCP-8903, all light sources within a 523 meter radius began to operate normally again. It was determined that SCP-8903 had grown a dependency on light level, on top of all of its required conditions.</p>
<p>A lighting system was installed within SCP-8903's chamber, with permanent lighting presented inside of it, however, at 18:00, all light sources within a 500 meter radius began to emit 500% more light than what was expected. Light sources only returned to normal operation after the lights in SCP-8903's chamber were turned off.</p>

<h2 id="toc4"><span><strong>ADDENDUM 8903-02:</strong></span></h2>
<p>On the 16th of March,202█, at 13:32, Dr. Enkei and Dr. Perl attempted to remove SCP-8903 from its pot.</p>
<p>As soon as SCP-8903 was lifted, an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 occurred at Site-██. As more force was put into lifting SCP-8903 was applied, the earthquake rose instantly to a magnitude of 6.7. Both Dr. Enkei and Dr. Perl stopped their attempt to raise SCP-8903 from it's container, as soon as SCP-8903 was placed down normally, the earthquake ceased.<br/>
Significant damage to Site-██ was recorded, with damages costing $428 million. No containment breaches occurred.</p>
<p>"It is currently unknown at what magnitude removing SCP-8903 from its pot would cause, and I want to keep it that way."<br/>
-Dr. Enkei.</p>
<p><strong>ALL ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE SCP-8903 FROM ITS POT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED</strong></p>
