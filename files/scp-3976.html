            <h1>SCP-3976</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3976</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Foundation web crawlers and personnel are to monitor media channels for any signs of an SCP-3976 manifestation. Once detected, containment and security personnel under the guise of UK national law enforcement are to be dispatched to the site of SCP-3976 to secure a perimeter and investigate the manifestation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3976 is the collective term for a series of manifestations of apparent murder scenes of famous mystery writer Agatha Christie<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Thus far, every SCP-3976 instance has been located in rural England, and all components of each instance have been limited to a 50-meter radius. Additionally, every instance has appeared between the hours of 22:31 and 08:36, local time, although no records or witnesses of a manifestation event exist.</p>
<p>Each SCP-3976 instance consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the corpse of Agatha Christie<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, designated SCP-3976. In each recorded instance, the corpse shows signs of violent struggle or murder.</li>
<li>Several items in some way related to murder. For instance, a murder weapon such as a gun or knife, or a personal artifact, such as a piece of jewelry or a diary.</li>
</ul>
<p>In no recorded SCP-3976 instance have there been any witnesses to a killing.</p>

Christie's corpse was exhumed for comparison and control and has been confirmed to be a separate object from the manifested corpse.
