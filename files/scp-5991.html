            <h1>SCP-5991</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5991</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Due to the widespread prevalence of Christianity, SCP-5991 cannot be contained. However, the chances of SCP-5991's activation requirements being achieved are low and thus unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>On 15/2/2026, "The Edwards-Francis Agreement" was passed with the Vatican government, which states that the bindings of all published Christian Bibles must contain <a href="/scp-5993">2ml of honey</a> in order to prevent SCP-5991 from occurring.</p>
<p>As per standard Foundation protocol, unauthorized information regarding SCP-5991 and its triggers is to be removed, and amnestics are to be administered as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5991 is an anomalous phenomenon that triggers whenever a human successfully consumes an entire Christian Bible. While the subject may consume the Bible using utensils such as forks or knives, SCP-5991 will not trigger if the subject consumes a Bible as well as another substance, such as condiments. When a subject consumes a Bible, an entity will manifest in front of them, referred to as SCP-5991-1.</p>
<p>SCP-5991-1 is a pale, emaciated entity with no orifices besides its mouth. SCP-5991-1 has no teeth, does not possess eye sockets nor eyes, and is wearing a crown of thorns. SCP-5991-1 will approach the subject and unhinge its own jaw. SCP-5991-1 will then violently shove the subject down its throat and into its stomach, which is noted to be much larger than SCP-5991-1 on the inside. SCP-5991-1's stomach is approximately 8 km<sup>3</sup> in size.</p>
<p>Once the subject is consumed by SCP-5991-1, they will land on a wooden boardwalk which is built on a floor comprised of biological tissue of unknown composition. Subjects are able to freely exit the stomach by pressing a large, pulsating orange sac located behind where the subject lands.</p>
<p>This will cause the sac to spray an orange gas which, when inhaled by the subject, will render them unconscious. When the subject wakes up after approximately 2-3 hours, they will find themselves in the same place where SCP-5991-1 consumed them.</p>
<p>The boardwalk extends to the middle of the stomach, which contains a plaza constructed out of marble. In the center of the stomach is an entity with the same appearance as SCP-5991-1, hereafter referred to as SCP-5991-2, reading from a small empty scroll while sitting on a wooden stool.</p>
<p>Several broken steel chains surround SCP-5991-2 which hook into SCP-5991-1's stomach lining. Small metal cuffs can be seen around SCP-5991-2's wrists. SCP-5991-2 does not respond to any external stimuli.</p>
<p>Surrounding SCP-5991-2 and the plaza are twelve buildings, which all thematically revolve around SCP-5991-2. SCP-5991-1's stomach contains a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitor's center</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gift shop</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Restroom</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Petting zoo</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Church</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Food court</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Museum</li>
</ul>
<p>The buildings are all themed around referring to SCP-5991-2 as "Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>The visitor's center contains a desk and a 2004 Dell desktop computer. Inside the desk are several piles of pamphlets which contain information regarding activities to do when visiting SCP-5991-1's stomach. Additionally, the pamphlets advertise being able to take a picture with SCP-5991-2 for $20 per picture. Several documents detailing an "Umbrella Protocol" in regards to an unknown event can be found, which describe previous evacuation attempts of persons inside the stomach.</p>
<p>The gift shop is mostly empty but contains several SCP-5991-2-themed memorabilia, including stuffed dolls, children's books, figurines, and posters. A total of $344.44 can be found within the cash register. The children's books describe events that never occurred within the Old or New Testaments, and instead describe SCP-5991-2 as a malevolent being that was turned to good through "the light of God."</p>
<p>Several inscriptions are carved within the walls of the bathroom written primarily in either English, Spanish, or Latin. Examples of these messages include "hello", "jenny wuz here", "sittin in a tree", "fuck the world", and "help" in the previously mentioned languages.</p>
<p>The petting zoo contains five large pens presumably built to hold farm animals, but which are completely empty. In the corner of one of the pens, a large pile containing approximately 50 kg of animal feces can be found. Analysis of the feces suggests that the animal that created it was fed a diet consisting solely of sacramental bread and red wine.</p>
<p>The church is unfinished, only consisting of a small sparsely decorated chapel. Nothing else of interest can be found.</p>
<p>The food court contains 40 different tables, each with five chairs. The menu describes food that can be expected from a standard fair or carnival, such as hotdogs, burgers, corn dogs, popcorn, etc. The menu describes a dairy item which resembles an ice cream cone with a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of chocolate ice cream. The vanilla scoop is shaped in a way as to resemble SCP-5991-2 and the chocolate scoop is shaped as to resemble a crown of thorns. The freezer inside the kitchen has been locked from the inside.</p>
<p>The museum shows Babylonian artifacts as well as several dinosaur skeletons of unknown species. All the plaques have been forcefully removed, and as such further information cannot be gathered.</p>
<p>As the subject enters SCP-5991-1's stomach, a large banner can be seen attached to the ceiling of the stomach, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>50th Anniversary of JesusLand! Enjoy the perfect Christian experience with the Lord!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:70%;">Select items in Gift Shop now 50% off until January 17th. See visitor center for more information.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is to be noted that SCP-5991-1's stomach has been abandoned for an unknown amount of time.</p>
