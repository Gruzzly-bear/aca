            <h1>SCP-4888</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4888</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-4888 no longer exists and therefore does not need to be contained. However, information relating to the existence of SCP-4888 should be scrubbed from all public repositories when possible. Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor traffic from sites of interest for key words relating to the existence of SCP-4888 and take proper action when applicable. At no time may any personnel attempt to interact with POI-4888-X, should an iteration appear.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4888 was the designation for former group of interest GOI-Σ ("The Sunrise Collective"). SCP-4888 was a large,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> anomalous covert organization with sightings located throughout the world. SCP-4888 primarily focused on the study and acquisition of anomalous objects.</p>
<p>SCP-4888 possessed a number of notable traits, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manifesting individuals (Designated SCP-4888-1) from an unknown location for a number of administrative, ancillary, containment and testing purposes.</li>
<li>Memory manipulation of large populations to conceal or otherwise control mass thought and awareness.</li>
<li>Omnipresence, to a degree that is uncertain. Should instances be discovered, personnel must assume SCP-4888 is once again aware of all or nearly all global Foundation activity.</li>
<li>Anonymity, as all DNA recovered from instances of SCP-4888-1 have yet to match any known database or government record.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The existence of SCP-4888 was known to O5-7 for nearly two decades prior<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> to their initial contact with Foundation personnel, and as such organized a large scale investigation into the organization which was ultimately unsuccessful. SCP-4888 was first encountered on ██/██/████, during the discovery and reconnaissance of a hostile entity taking the form of a large, bipedal wisent possessing maxillofacial augmentations resembling <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/your-future-is-bright">multiple rows of reciprocating sawblades</a>, detected ~14 km outside of the Site-76 campus. Foundation operatives arrived on the scene to find instances of SCP-4888-1 observing the entity as it attacked civilians. During personnel efforts to assume control of the situation, SCP-4888-1 entities reportedly began acting in a suspicious manner, attempting to converge onto the agents' location and ignoring verbal commands to cease these actions. This resulted in a small gunfight, which caused instances to abandon their approach. After the gunfire stopped, however, more instances emerged from multiple unknown locations, who proceeded to surround Foundation forces at a safe distance, unarmed.</p>
<p>Upon acknowledgement of SCP-4888's anomalous nature, an emergency joint summons of the O5 Council and the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA) was placed into effect to discuss further action. A representative from SCP-4888, designated POI-4888-X, approached Foundation personnel and asked to speak to a Council member. Individual refused to speak to anyone except the Council directly. After POI-4888-X began to express classified Level 5 knowledge, O5-2, O5-3, O5-5 and O5-7 agreed to meet on a secured channel, post-admission for emergency DAMMERUNG-Level memetic inoculation.</p>

<p><em>Note: Following this interaction, SCP-4888 was established as a Group of Interest.</em></p>
<p><strong>Incident Log 4888.1:</strong> Investigations into the locations associated with sightings of SCP-4888 would continue, without success, over the next three years. On 07/31/2019, suspicions of purposeful delay of progress within Foundation departments working on investigation of SCP-4888 led to the implementation of mandatory cognitohazard decontamination and genetic testing of staff. Throughout the following four months, approximately ██% of suspected Foundation personnel would be found to possess anomalous genetic markers also present in instances of SCP-4888-1. By order of the O5 Council, all individuals possessing anomalous genes<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> are to be contained and placed under supervision until further notice. Any attempts to conceal test results or harbor anomalous individuals will be treated as insubordination and will result in corrective action.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 4888.1:</strong> On ██/██/████, the O5 Council approved the use of <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1347">SCP-1347</a> to determine information about the nature of SCP-4888. Testing was carried out within a secure chamber on the grounds of Site-76, with Class-D personnel inputting chosen queries.</p>
<blockquote>

<span style="color: black"><strong>Note:</strong> It is unknown to what degree this is true, or how it should be interpreted. SCP-1347 moved to a triple lead-lined Faraday cage devoid of windows and cameras. One D-Class personnel is to be present during testing, all other personnel are to remain outside testing area until testing personnel have recorded the results of the test. Questions are to be provided to the D-Class using an anonymous, self-destructing digital message sent through a LAN-only computer.</span></p>

<p><em>Note: In response to the reply provided by SCP-1347 and the reaction of SCP-4888, all members of the O5 Council and key personnel of interest have been relocated to <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/spikebrennan-s-proposal">Facility T</a> in order to plan without fear of interception. All personnel involved are to submit to weekly Rapid Genome Sequencing (RGS) tests along with standard decontamination and identification procedures.</em></p>
<p><strong>Incident Log 4888.2:</strong> Following the events of Addendum 4888.1, an increase of SCP-4888-1 sightings were reported, usually encountered on the scene in areas with high anomalous activity and close vicinity to secure facilities worldwide. Evidence suggests SCP-4888-1 entities are likely materializing in response to the presence of anomalous activity itself, and are noted to observe phenomena but refuse to aid Foundation efforts of any kind. On 12/15/2019, several highly complex disinformation campaigns appear on various forms of public media depicting the Foundation as interlopers and "thought police"-esque militant forces. SCP-4888 suspected behind event. Counter-campaigns and amnestic glyphs embedded in various social media ads aid in the expulsion of unwanted data. O5 Council meets once more in Facility T to examine long term solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 4888.2:</strong> Negotiations with SCP-4888 were attempted following discussions in Facility T. POI-4888-X was contacted by making a number of anonymous posts on the Usenet forums and was then supplied access credentials for a secure chatroom to speak with O5-7.</p>

<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> I don't think it is necessary. I know it's you.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> Good, glad to see there is still some of that age-old wisdom in the Foundation.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> Have you come to give us good news?</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> I have an offer for you.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> And what is that?</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> Cooperation.</p>
<p>*<em><span style="color: orange">user</span> scoffs</em></p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> We both perform the same operations, in a sense. We want the same thing. There is no reason we can't co-exist.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> Unfortunately, that is where you are wrong.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> Let us tell you a story.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> You've been a part of this Foundation for over half a century. What you don't know is that your roots go farther back than any of your records will tell you.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> We remember it all. From before your <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/billiths-proposal">colonization of Earth</a>, your subjugation and destruction of <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1000">another sentient species</a>, the many times you've had to <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000">start fresh</a>. You made quite a name for yourself.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> I don't understand</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> Remember when we said you weren't the first ones to do your job?</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> Then you should understand our reaction to your presence. You've probably felt the same.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> Are you saying what I think you're saying?</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> There's no other way about it. We cannot co-exist, because you must be contained.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> You are an extraterrestrial threat to this world, its ecosystem.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> You need humanity to see how you see, so you can always be the hero of the story. Blameless in your martyrdom as the world goes up in flames. We'd point to your previous home as proof but, well, you know. Or you don't. Either way.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> We care not about the façade you have built for yourself. We will not hesitate to break it.</p>
<p><span style="color: orange">user:</span> Consider this your final chance. A new light of dawn approaches.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ccccff">O5-3:</span> They got it. They actually got it.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ccccff">O5-3:</span> So now, we pray, and hope this works.</p>
<p><span style="color: yellow">O5-7:</span> I'm not one for prayer. If the information that 1347 gave us is correct, there should be no issues, and it hasn't been wrong yet.</p>

<strong>Addendum 4888.3:</strong> Operation HIGHLANDER was approved by majority vote by the O5 Council on 4/3/2021, following the successful triangulation of SCP-4888's location using a modified thaumaturgic Trilateration Utility for Locating IP hosts (tTULIP) system. Records of the operation can be found below.<br/>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DOC 4888/HIGHLANDER</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TIME:</strong> 04/05/2021, &lt;18:16:00 GMT&gt;</p>
<p><strong>PREFACE:</strong> The following is a transcript of select events and conversation between members of Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand"), members of the O5 Council and Site-76 Director Mahmoodah Agarwal, in reference to the execution of Operation HIGHLANDER.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> Alright. Right Hand reporting. We're live now, about thirty kilometers out of Tristan da Cunha. Our friends at Mu-4 are telling us there's an inaccessible island out around here, they were connected via satellite uplink, most likely. That's how they were able to have internet all the way out here in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>A-3:</strong> It's not an inaccessible island, it's named <em>Inaccessible Island</em>, due to the sheer cliffs and rock beaches that make up its shores. It's actually quite ingenious considering its remote location. Probably the last place anyone would look.</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong> Affirmative. You're loud and clear, proceed to engage when ready.</p>
<p><strong>A-2:</strong> The payload is prepped for drop, just needs a push. Sure we shouldn't go down and speak to them first?</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> What is the point of getting the surprise factor if we announce ourselves? I honestly don't know if the antimemetic warding will be enough as it is.</p>
<p><strong>A-4:</strong> What antimemetic warding?</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> Just shut the fuck up, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>A-4:</strong> It was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> It wasn't funny.</p>
<p><strong>A-3:</strong> We are approaching the island now, boys. I don't see anything out of the ordinary—actually, there is a small building down there.</p>
<p><strong>A-2:</strong> Ground readings show a massive subterranean structure. That's gotta be it.</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> Alright. So you all should know how this is going to go down. We drop the package, wait for it to destabilize. If there is anything left when it all blows over, we go down and scope it out.</p>
<p><strong>A-2:</strong> Cap, you feel that?</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> Just some turbulence, winds in this area are pretty rough.</p>
<p><strong>A-2:</strong> Make sure we stay steady, I don't want to know what happens if we knock that thing over.</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> I'm putting her on auto soon.</p>
<p><em>At this point, the communications radio on the helicopter spontaneously opened, and an unknown voice is registered over all shortwave lengths in the general area. The party is assumed to be an instance of SCP-4888-1.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4888-1:</strong> Attention, unidentified craft. You are entering restricted airspace and are exhibiting aberrant behavior. Please land immediately or you will be subject to prosecution.</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> So much for the warding, but we expected that. Don't answer them. Send them a physical message. Go, now!</p>
<p><em>Sounds of shuffling are heard over the next thirty seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4888-1:</strong> Attention, unidentified craft. We know you can hear us. Please land immediately. We will not ask again.</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> Can someone shut that thing off?</p>
<p><strong>A-3:</strong> It <em>is</em> off.</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> Screw it, what are we looking at here?</p>
<p><strong>A-4:</strong> Everything is ready. Dropping in three.</p>
<p><strong>A-4:</strong> Two.</p>
<p><strong>A-1:</strong> Brace yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>A-4:</strong> One.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&lt;END LOG&gt;</p>

<p><em>Internal camera of X3 helicopter shows A-4 and A-2 pushing a large container into the view of the camera. After a moment, they lift it, while A-3 pulls the side door open. After another moment, they are seen dropping it off the side of the craft. Approximately five seconds later, a bright flash is seen, the helicopter buckling inward, bending towards the source. The dimensions of the aircraft appear to distort and extend, the camera fracturing and cutting out a moment later. Camera function returns after several minutes, the members of Alpha-1 are seen regaining consciousness.</em></p>

<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> So, you're telling me that the Foundation made an anomaly bomb and killed their big brother?</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> In a way. Once we received that list from 1347, I knew it would work. It was just <em>too</em> specific. And these anomalies were all relatively mundane. Take a few parts of <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1290">1290</a>, suspend <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2597">2597</a> in a stabilized vacuum, modified to work as an Alcubierre drive<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> gone wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> Still, it seems quite dangerous. And perhaps an overreaction?</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Incredibly dangerous, but not an overreaction. I know there are few circumstances in which we would willingly utilize so many other artifacts like we had. Hell, we rarely even target groups as is, let alone with intent of erasure.</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> And yet, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Indeed, we are. It was all too perfect though. I looked at that list and I just saw how it all fit together, the pieces. 2597 would never work for a true Alcubierre drive, but that was the point. The instant that casing fractured and the teleporter activated, it was all over. You try sending that weight through a bounded wormhole at 930 meters per second.</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> There had to be an easier way, though, right?</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> The point was to make as little of waves as possible. We knew they weren't completely omnipresent, we just had to keep our heads down, work in their blind spot until we were sure we could execute undetected. We put out false messages, incorrect dossiers. In the end, we were just the better liars. They were fallible, human, like us. It took two months to sort through the debris, and the island is probably about a third of the size it was ten years ago, but it all had to be done. We never found 2597, our calculations say it should have been annihilated upon impact. The force was so great that it manipulated physical space, you can see it in the footage.</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> And what of them? Surely they weren't all concentrated there. They supposedly had global reach—possibly farther.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> You are correct. We had some in containment at the time, and I'm sure there were others. They weren't <em>all</em> snuffed out after that bomb, but their organization was destroyed at its core. We haven't encountered any more of them nor received any threats from them since. They've either died, or left. The Sunrise Collective is no more. I think it is safe to say we won.</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> Somehow I feel like we still got the short stick here.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Consider it the best of all available options.</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> We get to clean up after the universe for the rest of time, with no help.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> This is our world. Surely it should be our responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> Is it though? I read the logs, what they said, about our colonization—</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Nothing you should mind. Like I said. This is our world. You wouldn't want to take that from us, would you?</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> What, I—no. Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>O5-7:</strong> Good. I think we are done here then. Return to your quarters. Tell no one of what you learned here. Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>Director Agarwal:</strong> Yes, sir.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</p>
<p>VOICE 1: [cough] Of course, it is never that simple—which is why Agarwal had to be amnesticized—why you will be too. If you spend enough time on this side of the Foundation, you learn to spot it, the scrubbing of history, the modification of truth to suit some higher purpose. It leaks through the cracks of our crumbling infrastructure. Half the Council will say one thing, half another. The fact that we are even having this conversation means that the half that think the truth should exist is still out there—Though I do enjoy our conversations.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: Even though I don't remember—wait—it's a lie? The bomb—?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: Went off without a hitch. But did it affect the Sunrise Collective? Not in the slightest. It was like a flesh wound—all cosmetic.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: The island complex was unaffected?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: No, the island was leveled. No signs of continued life. But the Collective is larger than Earth. They're larger than all of us.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: Where are they now?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: God knows. What I <em>do</em> know is that they are capable of a <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/broken-masquerade-hub">Masquerade-level</a> breach of secrecy. And that they aren't through with us. Not yet.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: How do you know?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: [pause] I know because I was told so.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: By whom?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: If you read the document—the one we approved for the public repository, that is—you'll see a note about how I knew the Collective existed before we encountered them. The part about RAINBOW ASTRA—</p>
<p>VOICE 2: I've read the file, I know what it says.<br/>
<br/>
VOICE 1: Well, it's bullshit. It's a bold faced lie, one of millions, but an important one. I was actually contacted by Foundation forces. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/welcome-to-delta-t">A task force from the future</a>.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: I'm not even surprised anymore. So, what, they told you where to look and you couldn't find them even then? Seems unhelpful.</p>
<p>VOICE 1: Not exactly.</p>
<p>VOICE 1: They came to me <em>for help</em>. They knew something was coming that they couldn't stop. An eventuality—A war. One we'd lose. Maybe one they had already lost.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: [silence]</p>
<p>VOICE 1: I know. I had the same reaction. The investigation, SCP-1347, the bomb—all my idea. Born from fear. A waste of resources and precious time, but I would have felt worse if I hadn't tried—Even though I'm now worried I've <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5541">instigated the war myself</a>. Time is something that will get the better of you no matter how much you think you understand it.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: So, why did they come to you, then? There must have been a reason to speak to you and only you.</p>
<p>VOICE 1: Of course. The Council, as I said, is enduring a great schism. We disagree on many fundamental things, but there are a few—issues—that have made us divided in a way we cannot recover from. We've split into cliques like children. I have the loyalty of Overseers that possess a more… nuanced view of the anomalous. Most importantly to my visitors, O5-4 and O5-11.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: And what do they have to do with this?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: They both have, or would have, <em>side projects</em> that were of interest to these travelers, and they knew that I was particularly close to them. Especially 11. When you die with someone and are reborn together, it changes you—even though it was Roger's <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2718">second time</a>.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: Since I'm getting a forget-me-now for this anyway, I might as well ask—what kind of side projects?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2759">Immortality</a>. <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2719">Transcendence</a>.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: [silence]</p>
<p>VOICE 1: I get it. Unethical, treasonous, against the very core tenets of the Founder. We deserved our bullets the first time, and we're wasting our double feature on something worse. Worse, but necessary. The Collective will not stop until the entirety of the Foundation is contained. They will unite the world and break the masquerade. The sun will rise one day and we will be gone, only the Collective will remain—and it will become Hell on Earth.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: Uniting the world and taking our job is Hell on Earth?</p>
<p>VOICE 1: You don't get it. To them, we are an escaped animal, imposing our idea of normalcy onto the reality around us. We change natural law to one we can understand, because humans are fragile, their minds break easily—</p>
<p>VOICE 2: This is your species you are talking about, you know.</p>
<p>VOICE 1: I'm well aware.</p>
<p>VOICE 1: They are my species, but my people are the Foundation—to them I am loyal, and therefore the whole of the Council is loyal to them, not humanity, despite our disagreement on methodology. That is the reality you will not learn in seminars, and in debriefs. We die enlightened—So that others may live in the dark.</p>
<p>VOICE 1: Ignorance. Ignorance is bliss. That's the gift we provide humanity.</p>
<p>VOICE 2: I can't deny I resent them a bit for it.</p>
<p>VOICE 1: Don't. Remember why we are doing this, why they can never know. We say it's for their safety, but it's for our safety. Imagine what the public would do to us if it all came crashing down. Then you'll know why we had to drop that bomb, and why we continue to do what we do, despite everything; we simply can't afford to lose.</p>
