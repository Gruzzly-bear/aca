<p>SCP-8053 prior to obtaining anomalous properties.</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8053</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8053 is contained in a humanoid containment cell at Site-17. The cell is to be modified to be sound-proof and installed with a digital display timer that synchronizes with the anomaly's activation. The cell is also to be supplied with a collection of literary material, a television set accompanied with a selection of pre-approved films, and several automatic air fresheners. Physical interactions with SCP-8053-A are to be avoided if possible. Personnel are to wear ARC flash suits and insulated gloves prior to physical interaction, should physical interaction be deemed necessary.</p>
<p>As SCP-8053-A possesses a deep-seated dislike of authority figures, SCP-8053-A is to be accompanied by a member of Site-17's D-Class personnel for enrichment purposes. The selected D-Class personnel is encouraged to engage in frequent conversation with SCP-8053-A and follow the requests the entity gives if they are deemed reasonable. Euthanization and/or sedation of SCP-8053-A is to be discontinued due to consistent ineffectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8053 is an electric chair constructed from wooden material. The object is not only able to operate without being connected to a power source, but is able to withstand all forms of physical damage. SCP-8053's anomalous properties appear to be interconnected with SCP-8053-A.</p>
<p>SCP-8053-A refers to Horrace Fish, a man who was charged with five counts of murder before incarceration and being sentenced to death in 1985.</p>
<p>SCP-8053-A is currently restrained in SCP-8053. Between intervals of five minutes, SCP-8053 will activate, electrocuting SCP-8053-A before briefly turning off. During this process, SCP-8053-A will suffer injuries expected for exposure to high voltages of electricity. Despite this, SCP-8053-A will not expire and all injuries inflicted unto SCP-8053-A will regenerate over the period of a few minutes. SCP-8053's behaviour is constant and autonomous. All attempts to forcibly deactivating SCP-8053 and/or removing SCP-8053-A from the anomaly conducted by the Foundation have failed.</p>
<p><strong>Acquistion:</strong> On the date of SCP-8053-A's scheduled execution, the prison had run out of supplies to carry out a successful lethal injection. Deciding to still carry out said execution, the prison opted to carry it out via electric chair. However, during the moment of activation, SCP-8053 spontaneously gained its anomalous properties, an event that both the prison staff and attending civilians witnessed.</p>
<p>Upon receiving notification that SCP-8053-A had failed to perish and SCP-8053 continued to activate autonomously, the Foundation intervened. All witnesses were administered Class-B amnestics. SCP-8053 was replaced with an identical model and SCP-8053-A was acquired by the Foundation via standard D-Class Acquisition protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Decline:</strong> Over multiple years in containment, it has been noted that SCP-8053-A's regenerative properties have declined. Though it is still able to recover from death inflicted by SCP-8053's electrocution, the period of time in which it remains deceased has increased from the original 10 seconds it took in 1985, to 3 minutes as of July 26th, 2015.</p>
<p>The SCP-8053 research team have opted to not inform SCP-8053-A of this information. However, SCP-8053-A appeared to possess knowledge of the fact its deaths were lasting longer during an enrichment interaction with D-Class personnel. See the attached log for further details.</p>

<p><em>[D-1221 enters the containment chamber and waves at SCP-8053-A as he approaches.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Hello, Horrace. How are you doing today?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> How do you think I'm doing?</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Sorry. <em>[D-1221 moves to grab a book from the bookshelf on the wall.]</em> Did you want to pick up from where we left off last time?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Well, uh. What do you want to do today then? Watch a movie?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> No. I'm feeling a little sentimental today. Let me tell you a story, son.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> You know what I did to get the chair?</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> No, I don't… but I can't imagine it was anything good.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> I strangled five women. All of them blondes. All of them young. All of them very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> I guess you can say you had a type, eh?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> I sure did. I know what I like, and I like choking the life out of young dumb blondes who look like my ex-wife. What got you into this situation?</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> I killed my cat and then my roommate.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Goodness, Eddie boy, I didn't know you were also a hard man.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> I'm not particularly proud of what I did. I was—am, mentally ill. I didn't know this until after I was analyzed by a court psychologist. It made so much sense after hearing it from someone smarter than me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Ah, so you're a nut. Heh. I met a few nuts in prison. My lawyer tried saying I was crazy, but the court wasn't buying it. But anyway, as I was saying, I killed five blonde bitches. I would submit my video profile for matchmaker services and get their number, then convince them to meet me in a park with a hiking trail, where I would butter them up and walk with them off the beaten path.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> And then you strangled them?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Smart as a whip, aren't you? Yeah. I would dump the bodies off a ravine and leave them there to rot. Everything was going fine until someone found them. I guess it's my fault. I got sloppy.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Do you regret what you did?</p>
<p><em>[SCP-8053-A laughs.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Not one bit. I took pleasure in watching their lives go out like a candle in the wind. In fact, I—</p>
<p><em>[An electric humming sound emanates from SCP-8053. The anomaly activates, electrifying SCP-8053-A. The subject twitches and writhes, screaming in pain.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Man, that smell is awful every time. Can you even smell it yourself, or are your nostrils fried?</p>
<p><em>[D-1221 covers his nose and looks away from SCP-8053-A. There are burn marks all over its body and its flesh is charred. The injuries begin to slowly reverse. SCP-8053-A remains unresponsive.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Horrace?</p>
<p><em>[Silence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Horrace? Hello? <em>[D-1221 waves his hand in front of SCP-8053-A's face.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8053-A jolts to life, gasping and staring up at D-1221.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Fuck!</p>
<p><em>[D-1221 jumps back a few paces, nearly falling over.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Shit! You scared the hell out of me, man! What took you so long to come to?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> What else? This rickety thing gets worse by the year. The shocks. The healing. In-between. <em>Everything!</em> The lab coats say it's nothing unusual but it's easy to say that from that side of the fucking screen! <em>[SCP-8053-A shouts in the direction of the two-view mirror. After growling, SCP-8053-A visibly calms.]</em> Ain't it?</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> I've started to die. It was bound to happen. This all began, what, 30 years ago? The fact I've made it this long without dying for good is a miracle. But every time I die, I die for a little longer.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> That sounds terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Want to know the real scary part?</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> There's nothing after.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> There's nothing waiting for me at the other side. An eternity of nothing. It's not even darkness. Just nothing.</p>
<p><em>[D-1221 fidgets.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> When I was a boy, my mom told me that if I didn't behave and do right by God, I would go to hell. But she always told me that hell would be fire and brimstone. This ain't that.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> I—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> No, it's fine, I just… don't know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> In a way, I guess I've earned it.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Well, let me ask you something, Eddie. Do you feel like you earned your punishment for doing what you did?</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Well… I regret what I did.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> That's not what I'm asking, son.</p>
<p><em>[D-1221 remains silent a moment.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Right then. I don't regret what I did. But I know it was bad. And I know that when you do bad, you get punished. I deserve this. It's only fair.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> I don't think anyone deserves to be electrocuted, killed, and be brought back to life for 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> And here I was thinking you were a hard man, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> Horrace, that's torture. I don't think anyone deserves to be tortured.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Well, I think I do. The world could use less sick fucks like me.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> I think you've atoned by now, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Heh.</p>
<p><em>[Researcher Simone enters the room. She looks to D-1221 and then to SCP-8053-A, then motions for the former to follow her.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Simone:</strong> Come. We have need of you elsewhere. You'll get to wrap this up later.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> But I—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Go with her, Eddie boy. I don't need these lab coat's pity parties. Nothing against you, son. But I know that you lab coats were keeping something from me, and now that I know what it is, I'm not gonna play ball with these prisoners you bring in to keep me company. Stop bringing them in.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Simone:</strong> Are you sure, Mr. Fish? We find that mental stimulation is helpful for humans in conta—</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Yes, I'm sure. Fuck off and leave an old man to die.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Simone:</strong> Very well. D-1221, please follow me.</p>
<p><strong>D-1221:</strong> I… okay.</p>
<p><em>[D-1221 and Researcher Simone exit the containment chamber.]</em></p>
<p><em>[SCP-8053-A is alone in the chamber. After a short period of time, SCP-8053-A begins to quietly hyperventilate. A tear stream emerges from its right eye. An electric hum is heard.]</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8053-A:</strong> Bring it.</p>
