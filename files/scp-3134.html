            <h1>SCP-3134</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3134</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> As removing SCP-3134 from its current habitat is impractical at this time, containment is instead to focus on keeping it from exiting Zone 29-Job. Containment teams in the area are to maintain their assigned front ('Department of Mine Clearance'), while patrolling said Zone regularly to maintain SCP-3134's containment. Zone 29-Job is currently defined as region near Verdun, France, publicly referred to as 'Zone Rouge'; an area environmentally devastated by combat during World War I.</p>
<p>As tourist activity was present in Zone 29-Job before the existence of SCP-3134 came to light, it is currently not feasible to remove civilian presence from the area. Instead, tourist presence in Zone 29-Job is to be influenced away from areas in the Zone frequented by SCP-3134. Any civilians who do report sightings of SCP-3134 are to be dosed with Class-A amnestics by on-site plainclothes personnel immediately.</p>
<p>Local spiritual clean-up organizations (See Addendum 3134-1) are to be monitored for any activity or communications regarding SCP-3134, and any suspected action on their part is to be neutralized at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>Food appropriate for SCP-3134, as dictated by Nutritional Chart 3134-1, is to be placed periodically within the center of Zone 29-Job in order to influence its movements. Planning and construction for permanent containment of SCP-3134 in an on-site facility is ongoing, and expected to be complete soon.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3134 is a large mammalian creature of black colouration, weighing 460kg with a standing height of 2m and a length of 2.6m. It appears to have suffered severe injuries in the past, including lacerations, burns and severe bruising throughout its body. SCP-3134 possesses features from a wide number of species, including multiple horns and antlers on its head, growths throughout its body resembling human facial features, and overall morphology similar to that of a bear. Despite these features, DNA analysis has revealed that SCP-3134 is genetically identical to a common rabbit.</p>
<p>Current evidence suggests that SCP-3134 can only survive within the bounds of Zone 29-Job. When removed from Zone 29-Job, SCP-3134 exhibits symptoms consistent with respiratory difficulties, followed by severe seizures and existing burns spreading over its body. These symptoms reverse themselves upon SCP-3134's return to Zone 29-Job. While it is unknown whether these symptoms would result in SCP-3134's death, it has been determined that testing of that nature presents an unacceptable level of risk to further SCP-3134 study.</p>
<p>Observation by on-site personnel has revealed that SCP-3134's diet consists mainly of unexploded shells, grenades and human remains. Although the first of these invariably explode during consumption by SCP-3134, it will quickly regenerate from such injuries.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> While SCP-3134 will not actively seek out humans, it does display severe hostility when it encounters them, often attempting to maul or otherwise attack them. SCP-3134 appears to prefer resting in trenches left from battles within Zone 29-Job.</p>
<p>Despite its animalistic behaviour and aggression, SCP-3134 has been known to display signs of intelligence, primarily through the forms of emotional response to presented media. (See Interview 3134-1)</p>
<p><strong>Interview 3134-1:</strong></p>
<p>On 12/08/2010, analysis of SCP-3134's living area while it was away feeding revealed what appeared to be a collection of photographs, arranged in a loose pile, believed to have been originally left behind by soldiers serving in the area which became Zone 29-Job. As SCP-3134 had not demonstrated such behaviour with any other items in Zone 29-Job<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, this was taken as possible evidence that SCP-3134 had higher levels of intelligence than originally believed, as well as a possible connection to the history of Zone 29-Job.</p>
<p>As a test of SCP-3134's intellectual capacity and the nature of its connection to Zone 29-Job, approval was given for an experimental interview to be conducted by the Abnormal Interrogations Department. Through the efforts of MTF-Psi-2 ("The Answer"), SCP-3134 was temporarily restrained in a manner suited for interview<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> forest within Zone 29-Job. Interview was conducted via SCP-3134 being presented with several enlarged photographs by Dr McCall to test for emotional response. Although most presented photographs yielded no clear results, the following stimuli resulted in abnormal responses:</p>

<p>Shortly after the final photograph was presented, SCP-3134 broke through its restraints and escaped into the surrounding forests. Construction of a covert installation in Zone 29-Job dedicated to containing SCP-3134 was approved after this point.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3134-1:</strong> On ██/██/20██, several professional exorcists associated with the PWSSR<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> attempted to infiltrate Foundation-controlled areas of Zone 29-Job in a presumed effort to neutralize SCP-3134. These individuals were intercepted, dosed with Class-B amnestics and released.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> Investigation is ongoing regarding how this group gained knowledge of SCP-3134.</p>
<p>Several items of interest were retrieved from these individuals while in custody, including several coded crystal matrixes<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>, large amounts of holy water and refined chalk, as well as a copy of A.A.
