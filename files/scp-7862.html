</div>
</div>
<p>All personnel assigned to SCP-7862 must adhere to strictly vegan diets. No individual who has consumed an animal product in the last four months may approach SCP-7862.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7862 is a restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>
<p>SCP-7862’s properties manifest whenever a potential victim sees it. To be a potential victim, a subject must have consumed an animal product in the last ninety days. Such individuals are compelled to enter the restaurant and consume all organic matter served to them.</p>
<p>Victims are waited on by humanoid entities designated SCP-7862-1. The appearances of SCP-7862-1 instances vary. All observed instances have possessed non-human facial structure, with avian, bovine and porcine features being especially common.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum: Exploration Log:</strong></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Shortly after researchers discovered that those observing proper dietary restrictions could enter SCP-7862 safely, Dr. Alberts was sent inside with D-63368 in order to observe an activation event.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log, November 8, 1997, 13:19&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> So, what’s this place we’re going to?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> <em>Gestures toward SCP-7862</em> Right there.</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Is that a restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> You guys said you deal with weird stuff. What exactly is weird about it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> We’re about to see.</p>
<p><em>They enter SCP-7862. An SCP-7862-1 instance with porcine features approaches D-63368.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Is that thing supposed to be a waiter?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> …Alright.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7862-1 leads D-63368 to a booth. D-63368 sits. Dr. Alberts remains standing. SCP-7862-1 retreats into the kitchen.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Are you going to sit?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> No. We don’t know if it’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Right. That’s what you need me for.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> The agreement you signed—</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Said there was a chance of physical danger. Don’t worry. I remember.</p>
<p><em>Several minutes later, SCP-7862-1 returns with a sixteen-ounce glass of lukewarm, cloudy liquid topped with thick layer of foam. Analysis has since shown this substance to be bovine saliva.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> I think it’s your drink.</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> I’m not drinking that!</p>
<p><em>Despite this statement, D-63368 grabs glass and lifts it toward his mouth.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> What the fuck am I doing? Why am I—</p>
<p><em>D-63368 drinks.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> What the fuck? What the fuck is this stuff? It tastes like shit.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> You find yourself unable to stop consuming the beverage?</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> I can’t stop. I’m trying, but I can’t stop.</p>
<p><em>D-63368 takes another sip. Once he sets the glass back down, Dr. Alberts takes a sample of liquid.</em></p>
<p><em>D-63368 consumes the glass over the course of the following ten minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Doc, please, what the fuck did I just drink?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> We haven’t yet identified that substance.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7862-1 emerges from the kitchen carrying a small bucket.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Oh God, that thing’s coming back. Is it going to make me drink more?</p>
<p><em>SCP-7862-1 places bucket onto table. Bucket is full of porcine teeth.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Are those teeth?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Alberts collects tooth and places it in sample bag.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> <em>Reaches into bucket and pulls out a single tooth.</em> Wait, why am I—</p>
<p><em>D-63368 Places the tooth inside his mouth and begins to chew. Loud crunching is audible, along with a strained cry of pain. As would be expected, the tooth’s hardness damages the interior of D-63368’s mouth. By the time subject swallows, blood is leaking from his cheek, and his voice carries a distinctive lisp.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Doctor, please, you have to help me. I can’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> Noting continued compulsion.</p>
<p><strong>D-63368:</strong> Please, get me out of here!</p>
<p><em>D-66368 grabs a handful of teeth and begins chewing them. Subject continues to plea for Dr. Albert’s assistance, though his words become unintelligible after several minutes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> I observe significant damage to interior of victim’s mouth. Large amount of blood obscures details of injuries.</p>
<p><em>D-63368 consumes remaining teeth over following hour. By the end of this process, damage to subject’s mouth has rendered him incapable of speech. Shortly after the course is finished, SCP-7862-1 returns. D-63368 screams, reaching toward Dr. Alberts and attempting to rise from booth, but finding himself unable to stand.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-7862-1 places pink bowl containing clear liquid later identified as porcine gastric acid on table. D-63368 sobs. Despite apparent attempts to hold his dominant hand in place, D-63368 grabs provided spoon and begins to scoop acid into his mouth. Subject wails in pain as acid makes contact with oral interior. Dr. Alberts takes sample of liquid.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> Noting apparent chemical burns to interior of subject’s mouth.</p>
<p><em>D-63368 continues scooping acid into his mouth. Eventually, enough damage accumulates that traditional swallowing is impossible. Subject is forced to angle head back to facilitate consumption.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> Noting subject has suffered what should be fatal damage to throat. SCP-7862 appears to be keeping him anomalously conscious and animate.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7862-1 returns with another bowl containing long pink noodles mixed with dark green sauce later identified as bile. D-63368 sobs as he grasps provided fork and impales noodle. Noodle is animate and deliberately wraps itself around fork. D-63368 uses fork to transport noodle to mouth and allows it to crawl inside.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Alberts collects a single noodle and places it inside sample container.</em></p>
<p><em>Over course of following hour, D-63368 slowly consumes remaining noodles.</em></p>
<p><em>D-63368 thrashes as SCP-7862-1 emerges from kitchen with another course. Course consists of large, hot wedge of feces decorated to resemble chocolate cake.</em></p>
<p><em>D-63368 sobs for several minutes after course is served before eating. Subject utilizes fork to scoop small chunks of fecal matter into mouth. With each bite, subject recoils from feces’ odor. Once last of feces is consumed, subject expires.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Alberts:</strong> Noting subject’s apparent expiration.</p>
<p><em>SCP-7862-1 emerges once again and approaches D-63368’s body, which it lifts and carries into SCP-7862’s men’s restroom. Dr. Alberts follows but finds the door locked. When Dr. Alberts finally gains access to restroom, neither D-63368 nor SCP-7862-1 are present.</em></p>
