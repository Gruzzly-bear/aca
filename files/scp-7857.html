<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The area SCP-7857-2 instances reside in are deemed highly secure. Due to this, the containment of SCP-7857-2 and SCP-7857-3 has been deemed impossible; however, due to the lack of signs of threat against humanity, containment may not be necessary. MTF Mu-3 ("Highest Bidders") are to visit Barsø Bädelav every week. Designated personnel are not to remain in proximity with SCP-7857 for no longer than twenty-five (25) minutes under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Designated personnel are given authorization to explore the interior of SCP-7857 for no longer than five (5) minutes. Personnel who have been caught by SCP-7857-1 instances are to be sent to disciplinary action immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7857 is an undefined organization possessing a 50,000 Square-Meter facility adjacent to Barsø Bådelav (55.121269°N 9.558950°E) . All known entrances throughout SCP-7857 are identified to be triple-locked at all times. SCP-7857 employs an undefined number of personnel designated SCP-7857-2 — formally thought to be 250,000.</p>
<p>SCP-7857-2 instances assume the appearance of a humanoid entity either male or female of unknown descent. SCP-7857-2 instances are deemed non-anomalous. SCP-7857-2 instances deploy SCP-7857-3 instances indiscriminately.</p>
<p>SCP-7857-3 is a colossal zeppelin-like aircraft constructed by SCP-7857-2 instances. SCP-7857-3 is constructed of mostly Titanium and seems to not utilize mechanism or fuel. SCP-7857-2 instances deploy at least three (3) instances of SCP-7857-3 every week. In the event of the designated SCP-7857-3 instance reaching its destination, subject is mandated to continuously release A4 papers. The aforementioned A4 Papers contain extremely concealed information about a specific individual that SCP-7857-2 instances have designated (e.g. subject's <em>deepest dark secret</em>, email address, trauma information).</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7857-a1:</strong> SCP-7857-2 instances utilize a computer system referred to as "Intel". The Intel allows SCP-7857-2 instances to gather all information about individuals worldwide in a short period. The location of the Intel is in the -7F (negative seventh-floor) Research laboratory, which has been discovered following the incident of MTF Mu-03 ("Highest Bidders") exploring the underground base of SCP-7857.</p>
<p>The mechanism inside the Intel is unknown. MTF Mu-03 ("Highest Bidders") are being designated to destroy this Intel.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 7857-a2:</strong> Individuals from █████ Town, Georgia spotted an instance of SCP-7857-2 falling outside of SCP-7857-3 during its event on June 11, ████. Individuals who have witnessed the aforementioned event have reported this incident to the police and ambulance.</p>
<p>MTF Mu-03 ("Highest Bidders") have been deployed and held the SCP-7857-2 instance captive. Agent Juile interviewed the SCP-7857-2 instance to gather information.</p>
<p>The following dialog below describes the interview.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Interview ID #: 7857aup0</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer: Agent Juile</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interviewed: SCP-7857-2 instance</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> Greetings, S. C. P seven-eight-five-seven dash two. I am Agent Juile. I was sent here to interview you so we could gather more information.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> I would appreciate it if you refrain from calling me S. C. P seven-eight-five-seven dash two as I do not know what that is. From now on and soon, call me "Kim".</p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> Ah, so you have a name. Alright Kim, why did you work for this organization? If you are kind enough, can you tell me what its established name is? Do your co-workers have names too?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> (no response) I did not work for this organization. I just woke up and I was just there. And yes, everyone in the facility has names.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> I see. What is this organization's established name?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> I believe that information is confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> Any specific reasons?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> They just don't like it. They are watching right now. I know it. I recommend you don't ask me things regarding this organization.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> Right. This may sound a bit… Odd… But… Are you human?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> (distracted, staring at the wall blankly) what?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> Are you a human being?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> (pause) well… well yes. What else would I be?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> Good. Last question, and we'll escort you to your room. You will be staying here the rest of your life, Mr. Kim.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> Go on with it, please.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Juile:</strong> Why is this organization revealing everyone's secrets? A secret's a secret, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-7857-2 instance:</strong> (angered-like tone) The… The truth will… The truth will always prevail</p>
<p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p>

<p>The interviewed SCP-7857-2 instance seems to identify itself as "Kim". SCP-7857-2 instances are proven to be intelligent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I don't know what has gotten into him."</em></p>
<p><em>"Because of that… that thing… It caused him harm. No, he caused the harm himself."</em></p>
<p><em>"When is this thing gonna go away? Is- Is anyone even gonna try to stop it? Damn, these people are too lazy to do something."</em></p>
<p><em>"I don't know anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I could feel… Feel his feelings. Why does that thing even exist?"</em></p>
<p><em>She lit the candles</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Addendum 7857-a3:</strong> MTF Mu-03 ("Highest Bidders") have been deployed to Barsø Bådelav on August 2, ████. Subjects discovered an unsecured hatch behind the facility, which had led to vents. Agent Michael and Agent Sakurai saw a caucasian humanoid entity holding a meeting in an undefined room. The aforementioned entity was deemed as the CEO of SCP-7857.</p>
<p>Efforts have been made to hold the CEO captive; however, the CEO seems to not always be in proximity to SCP-7857. Its reason for absence is unknown.</p>
