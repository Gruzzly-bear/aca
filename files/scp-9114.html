</div>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-9114 is housed in a standard Humanoid Containment Cell at Site-███. To maintain long-term containment stability, SCP-9114 is to be assigned a designated <em>“squire,"</em> selected from D-class personnel. The squire is responsible for basic maintenance<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> of SCP-9114 and must sustain its perceived hierarchical expectations. Religious services are to be made available to SCP-9114 every Sunday.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-9114 is no longer considered reliably cooperative.</span> It must be fully restrained prior to any transport. During transit, it is to be escorted by no fewer than two security personnel. Instances of aggression or rapid behavioral escalation are to be met with appropriate force.</p>
<p>Due to repeated incidents of targeted hostility, direct interaction with SCP-9114 is restricted to personnel who identify as Catholic, ethnically European, and heterosexual. Communications with SCP-9114 must acknowledge, but not reinforce, its expectations of authority and deference.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-9114 is an animate 15th-century suit of plated armor, approximately 1.75 m in height. Its construction and ornamentation match armaments from midland regions of the Holy Roman Empire. Despite lacking a gambeson or internal framework, all components remain suspended and articulate as though worn by a human body. Individual plates can be removed but autonomously return to their correct positions once released.</p>
<p>SCP-9114 produces vocalizations from within its helm consistent with an adult male of roughly 40 years. It is capable of verbal communication limited to Low German and basic Latin.</p>
<p>The mechanism enabling SCP-9114’s movement and vocalization is currently unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-9114 is generally compliant with Foundation personnel and containment procedures when interactions conform to its medieval Catholic worldview and perceived social hierarchies. However, it becomes verbally hostile and may escalate to physical aggression when confronted with individuals or statements it deems <em>heretical</em>, often requiring restraint under such circumstances.</p>

<strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-9114<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Mr. Justin Josef Holzer; Father Jule.<br/>
<strong>Foreword:</strong> During renovation work at Burg Bruck, Austria, SCP-9114 was uncovered and subsequently fled the site, seeking ecclesiastical asylum at a church near Lienz. All civilian witnesses were amnesticized except for Father Jule, who voluntarily entered Foundation custody to aid in SCP-9114’s evaluation.</p>
<hr/>
<p>[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p>[Father Jule enters the interview chamber. SCP-9114 is sitting at the table in the center of the room.]</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> Good evening, my son. I am Father Jule. May I sit with you for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> I ken thee. Thou art the priest of Lienzina.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> Aye, please.</p>
<p>[Father Jule sits down at the table, opposite SCP-9114.]</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> If you are willing, I will need to ask you a few questions about yourself. They are required by those overseeing our care.</p>
<p>[SCP-9114 straightens up and gestures with its gauntlet.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Cert! Ask, Father.</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> Let us begin simply. Your name, and the role you held.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> I am Sire Sebastian of Almain, sworn knight unto His Lordship Friedrich III. Ac men call me Sebastian the Great. I rode where law was feeble and order troubled. I kept His orchard whole… and His folk sof… Think me a Shepard!</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> You speak with great certainty, Sebastian. And yet… I sense a burden behind your words. As though something remains unresolved. You have been carried far from your own time, and into a world unfamiliar to you. Such a trial would weigh heavily on any man.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Nay, Father. That is not the wound.</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> Then tell me what does trouble you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> <em>[Pauses]</em> I am not troubled by dread, not by distroubling. Swich things beeth for lesser men.</p>
<p>[SCP-9114 shifts in its chair.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Ac thou understand well. Unright is at werk.</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> Unright? What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Thou art Godes man. And so I shall speak plain to thee. Fram the day I held first a sword, til the hour I fell on field, I served His name. Each breath fram dawn til dusk given to His bliss. I bore His rode across the land, and held up His law. <em>[Voice rising]</em> By right, I should stand at His golden throne! I earned mine stand in His Kingdom! And yet here I langode, bitwixen life and death.</p>
<p>[SCP-9114 slams its gauntlet on the table]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Tell me, Father, why the scythe tard to fetch me? Why leave His true to rusten, while lesser men fest in His light? WHY!</p>
<p>[A long silence.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> …Forgive me, Father. I have spoken unbidden.</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> You have endured much, Sebastian. Any man placed under such strain might cry out as you have. <em>[Pause]</em> I cannot claim to understand the Lord’s purposes. He does work in ways we seldom understand. But I can say this: you are not abandoned here. You need not face this alone. If truth is to be found, we will seek for it together.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> I thank thee, Father, and bid thee speak sooth. Truth… That is all that I have ever served.</p>

<p><strong>Compiled by:</strong> Dr. Emmat Hartmann<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 04/09/1947</p>
<hr/>
<p>Confirming the identification of a knightly personality <em>"Sir Sebastian [the Great]"</em> active within southern territories of the Holy Roman Empire between 1430 and 1450.</p>
<p>Sources characterize the individual as a militant figure used by various Habsburg officials to enforce political and religious authority, eventually being given operational freedom. While exact numbers cannot be reliably reconstructed, multiple independent accounts describe his involvement in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppression of Protestant groups through violence.</li>
<li>Participation in witch trials (frequently cited as the primary executor).</li>
<li>Military action against Saracen merchants.</li>
</ul>

Fearing mischief I went unto the abbey gate. There came running a woman of that people, a babe upon her breast, crying for right of sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
I confess unto you, O Lord, that I purposed to grant it, I truliche did. But ere a word form, an arrow flew and struck her in the back, so that she fell upon the threshold. The babe wailed in her arms.<br/>
<br/>
Then rode forth Sire Sebastian on steed. He took the babe from the dead woman and bade me pardon the disorder. He cast me a silver coin for alms.<br/>
<br/>
As he straddled his horse, he passed by our well. There he let fall the babe into the water. And so departed he, without haste. I cried unto my brothers that we might draw the bebe up, yet alas, we were too late […]<br/>
<br/>
[…] When we reached the Jewry, we found only the blackened frames of dwellings and the air smelt of cooked meats. Of the people there was no sign, neither man nor woman nor child. […]</p>
</div>
<br/>
Records suggest the figure was reported <em>“fallen in battle,”</em> though no burial site or reliquary has yet been identified. Examination of Burg Bruck’s subterranean chambers revealed no corresponding human remains.<br/>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Psychology Department Log</strong></p>
<hr/>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
Following <em>Interview 9114.02</em>, SCP-9114 was referred for ongoing psychological evaluation at the request of the Anthropology Department. The Subject represents a rare opportunity for first-hand psychological, cultural, and theological study of a 15th-century worldview. However, behavioral instability has resulted in a lower level of cooperation.</p>
<p>SCP-9114 consented to sessions only after the procedures were framed as spiritually restorative and recommended by Father Jule.</p>
<p>Below is an abridged record of relevant reports.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 11/09/1947<br/>
<strong>Report:</strong> SCP-9114 diagnosed with identity destabilization. Subject persistently reiterates a singular self-concept regardless of corrective input. Attempts at historical or ethical reframing produce no observable variance. Prognosis for cognitive reframing is poor but not ruled out with prolonged intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 13/09/1947<br/>
<strong>Report:</strong> Formal treatment regimen initiated. Sessions emphasize guided self-reflection while avoiding direct confrontation of moral culpability. Subject engages readily, displaying confidence and humor, but consistently redirects discussion towards the grandeur of their role. No deviation in conclusions observed across multiple sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 25/09/1947<br/>
<strong>Report:</strong> SCP-9114 verbally agrees to <em>“reflection”</em> when prompted but reliably terminates discussion when approaching acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Pattern repeated across sessions without progression.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 19/10/1947<br/>
<strong>Report:</strong> Marked withdrawal observed following continued stagnation. SCP-9114 requests prolonged isolation and declines sessions. Subject spends extended periods seated at its bed or engaged in prayer. Cooperation with the Anthropology Department is at an all-time low. References parts of Father Jule’s sermons increasingly.</p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 02/11/1947<br/>
<strong>Report:</strong> SCP-9114 demonstrates renewed cognitive activity. Subject appears to be restructuring internal framework, resulting in improved consistency and reduced agitation during sessions. Frequently cites prior statements made by Father Jule out of original context, and Scripture readings from assigned squire; sessions conducted privately at Subject’s insistence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10/11/1947<br/>
<strong>Report:</strong> Sudden behavioral consolidation observed. SCP-9114 presents elevated mood and renewed certainty. Subject insists repeatedly on immediate contact with Father Jule. Given improved cooperation, request approved. Further psychological intervention suspended pending outcome.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Father… thou wert right. Right all long.</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> You believe I was?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Aye, as thou said. God brought thou to me. So that the world may see. See He gifted me another chance.</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> Sebastian… that gladdens me to hear. Truly. If you have found peace, then I thank God for it.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> No need us here waste, Father. Answer is complete. Gather thine belonging. Give them mine squire. On dawn we depart for Lienzina. Thine town shall be the first to get freed.</p>
<p>[Father Jule rises in a panicked state, standing between SCP-9114 and the door]</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> No- I cannot permit this!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> Get thou side, Father. We have much to do.</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> NO! I cannot allow this- This injustice!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> I <em>am</em> justice!</p>
<p>[SCP-9114 strikes Father Jule with the back of a gauntlet. Father Jule falls.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> I would not strike thee, Father. Alas thou persist in error, even though God spoke to me through thee. I weep to foreloose swell friendship, ac dutdom must be served.</p>
<p>[SCP-9114 forces the chamber door open. Sounds of shouting and a struggle with security personnel follow.]</p>
<p><strong>SCP-9114:</strong> <em>[Audible from beyond the door]</em> Bar thou Godes path? Thou darest deny mine werk! Hethens!</p>
<p>[Father Jule remains on the floor, holding his crucifix]</p>
<p><strong>Father Jule:</strong> I’ve… I’ve failed you, Sebastian. God forgive me…</p>

<p><strong>Additional:</strong> SCP-9114 was successfully recontained following the above incident. Two security personnel sustained major injuries during the engagement. An emergency review of SCP-9114’s Special Containment Procedures has been initiated.</p>
