</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4515</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Internet video hosting sites and social media platforms are to be monitored for any new instances of SCP-4515 using neural network analysis bot Iota-75 ("Brain Candy"). Any found instances are to be downloaded to a remote storage device for cataloging and expunged from all related sites. All individuals known to have viewed the instance in question are to be detained and transferred to Site-401 for standard humanoid containment until further notice. Cataloged videos are not to be viewed at this time.</p>
<p>Additionally, all efforts are to be dedicated to locating the source behind every instance of SCP-4515 as well as any information regarding SCP-4515-A. Research into reversing the effects of SCP-4515 is currently underway; all research inquiries are to be directed towards lead researcher Dr. Hightower.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4515 is the designation given to a series of internet videos created in the style of the popular educational YouTube channel, Vsauce. While the format for SCP-4515 instances mirrors that of the original series, the topics featured in each instance differ wildly from that of a typical Vsauce video.</p>
<p>SCP-4515-A refers to the anomalous humanoid entity featured in every video. This entity, by all accounts, looks identical to the host of the show that SCP-4515 is based on. The host of the official channel, hereby referred to as PoI-4515, expresses no knowledge of any of these videos.</p>
<p>SCP-4515 manifests itself on any website that allows video hosting, ranging from popular sites such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion, to unorthodox ones such as PornHub or pirated media hosts. The manifestations do not seem to follow a pattern, as the time between uploads and the site on which each instance appears is different every time. Locating the source of these videos thus far has been unsuccessful, as the IP addresses of each uploader point to unique locations that do not exist.</p>
<p>Following Incident 4515-Alpha, access to archives of SCP-4515 has been restricted to research purposes only. Any and all requests for access must be sent to lead researcher Dr. Hightower.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4515.2:</strong> Incident Report 4515-Alpha:<br/>
On 11/12/201█, reports of cult activity located inside an abandoned warehouse emerged in Kansas City, Missouri. Foundation agents were sent to investigate while a disinformation campaign and general Class-A amnestics were deployed to the local population as needed.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the warehouse, the officers called for backup when they found a group of 15 people all bearing facial structures similar to PoI-4515. They found the group crowded around a pile of wooden boxes set up in the middle of the warehouse. Resting on top of the boxes, a human male was cut open with his heart and genitals missing, surrounded by various educational paraphernalia. Four lines shaped in the style of the Vsauce logo were painted on the ground, bearing the consistency of a green viscous liquid. Later tests revealed the liquid to have the same chemical makeup as Nickelodeon brand toy slime.</p>
<p>All members were detained and brought in for questioning.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> Did you always look like the host from Vsauce?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> Of course not. We all started as our old, unfinished forms until we saw the light.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> What exactly happened to cause this change? And what do you mean by "the light"?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> We all watched his videos. His true videos, not the meaningless crap that he posts to his simpleton "Vsauce" channel. Once I saw the truth, everything made sense.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> Uh-huh. And what “truth” would you be referring to?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> The fact that we are all broken. Clay tossed aside to be forgotten. And it is through him and his divine knowledge that molds us into what we should be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackerman:</strong> I see. What was your group attempting in the warehouse?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> If you saw the light, you would understand. Watching his videos was simply not enough. We needed a proper sacrifice for him, to show him what he means to us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> Interesting. Do you know of any way to reverse the effects of the videos?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> Why would we want to go back? We are perfect now. Nobody would ever want to discard that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> Well, let's say that someone does.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> You think I would just let his cause go to waste, just like that? You are sorely mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> So you're saying a cure exists?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> In order to swap, the readings are going to have to cross at least once.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> They can be named more than once, and be colored in more than one color.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ackermann:</strong> I'm not following.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4515-Alpha-011:</strong> The circuit will be complete, and the lamp will be on.</p>
<p>SCP-4515-Alpha-011 attempts to strangle Dr. Ackermann. Security personnel enter the interview chamber and escort SCP-4515-Alpha-011 back to his chambers.</p>

<p><strong>PoI-4515:</strong> Alright then. Shoot me, officer. …In the metaphorical sense, of course. Don't actually shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hightower:</strong> Yes, of course… So our first question is, do you post your videos to any sites besides YouTube? Or do you ever post videos under to YouTube under different channel names?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-4515:</strong> Well, the only channels that I personally post under are the same ones I've always posted to: our main channel and my personal channel. I don't see why we would post our videos anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hightower:</strong> Okay, good to know. Do you know of anyone else that would be posting under your name?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-4515:</strong> Well besides the other guys posting to our spin-off shows, I don't know anyone who would have access to our channels. Why, did something come up?</p>

<p><strong>PoI-4515:</strong> Alright, I guess that's fine. Hey, since we're on the topic, you guys wouldn't happen to have received any information about a guy named Jake Roper<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup>, would you? He hasn't been responding to our messages for the past few days, and I wasn't sure if you guys knew anything about where he might be.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hightower:</strong> From my knowledge, no, we haven't. If you'd like to make a missing person’s report, our department has forms that you can fill out.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-4515:</strong> Yeah, figured as much. I definitely didn't want to resort to filing a missing person's report, but it's just not like him to disappear like that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hightower:</strong> Nobody does. Hopefully, you'll hear from him soon. Alright, we just have one more question. Have you heard of any of your viewers expressing cult-like behaviors based on you or your channels?</p>
<p><strong>PoI-4515:</strong> Cult behavior? Besides having a "cult" following, heh… [PoI-4515 clears his throat] No, I've never heard of anyone using our channels as a basis for a cult. Is there something going on with our channels that I should be aware of? This sounds pretty serious.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Hightower:</strong> No, nothing you need to worry about. Thank you for your time, that's all the questions that we had for you.</p>
<p><strong>PoI-4515:</strong> Oh, alright. [PoI-4515 grimaces as though experiencing pain] Hopefully whatever is happening can get sorted out quickly.</p>
<p><strong>[End Log]</strong></p>
