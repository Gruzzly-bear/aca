            <h1>SCP-4889</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4889</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Early Containment Procedures:</strong> The forested area that SCP-4889 is located in is surrounded by two-meter tall chain-link fencing in a 120 meter radius from its exact location. Foundation interaction is currently restricted to remote observation until more information about SCP-4889-A is known and a safe method of capture for it is proposed. Secondary containment objectives include identifying SCP-4889-A's origin and known relatives.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4889 refers to a snowshoe hare (<em>Lepus americanus</em>) 49 cm in length. It is located approximately 9 km northeast of Lake Cavanaugh in Washington State.</p>
<p>SCP-4889 is unable to leave the rock it stands on; the bottom of its paws are fused to the rock by unknown means. In addition, SCP-4889 possesses a regenerative trait, being able to replace lost tissue and organs.</p>
<p>SCP-4889-A is a human of indeterminate age, though it is presumed to be in its mid-twenties. Its clothing has not changed since its discovery.</p>
<p>Approximately 2 hours after snowfall in the area SCP-4889 resides in, SCP-4889-A will appear and devour SCP-4889 alive. This process varies in length, ranging from 30-120 minutes. Approximately 30 minutes after, SCP-4889 will begin regenerating its organs and rebuilding torn muscle and flesh, as well as regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>As inferred from observation, SCP-4889-A seems to do this out of survival, although it is also possible that it is doing so as ritual.</p>
<p><strong>Observation Log:</strong> Below is recorded footage taken via discreet cameras and microphones in the forest surrounding SCP-4889.</p>

<p><strong>OBSERVATION LOG TRANSCRIPT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> February 9th, 2019</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889 is still. Little activity for approximately three minutes. A soft crunching noise can be heard approaching from the west. SCP-4889-A enters the frame, moving past the trees and towards SCP-4889. SCP-4889-A has a noticeable limp, putting more weight on its right leg.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A slows its pace into a halt.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A looks around all directions.</em></p>
<p><em>It is still for approximately 30 seconds before approaching SCP-4889. SCP-4889 attempts to move from its stone but fails. SCP-4889-A crouches down and shushes it, putting its left hand on SCP-4889's back and petting it. SCP-4889 ceases moving, save for visibly quick breaths.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A puts its other hand on SCP-4889 and feels its body, paying little attention to the paws and rear end.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> You're a little bigger tonight, I see. Must've been several days since the last snow. Or maybe little meat left over. Yeah… Probably that.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A feels around SCP-4889's ears.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> Still soft. I've always liked your ears.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A makes a noise suggesting the retracting of saliva. SCP-4889 is visibly startled by this.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> Oh! Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry. Shh shh sshhhh. It's okay.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A repeats these phrases for approximately 40 seconds, then sits directly in front of SCP-4889.</em></p>
<p><em>Everything is still for approximately twenty seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> Brother came to visit me. Said that he's almost done with college. I told you about that, right? … I think I did. I didn't say anything; I don't really want to. He knows that — I know he knows that.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A retracts its hands and rests them on its knees.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> … It's not why he came, though. Told me dad started coughing up again. He said… He said it's because…</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A rubs its left leg with both hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> … Because it's my fault. But how is it my fault if I don't know how much I should eat?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A takes a few deep breaths.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> I told him, "You act like you've got it harder than me." …</p>
<p><em>Everything is still for a brief moment. SCP-4889-A laughs lightly.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> He didn't like that. Not one bit. But… But what am I supposed to do, right? He ain't helping me. Dad definitely ain't helping me. If he's so "alive and well", then where is he, huh? … And you know what he said?</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A rubs its left leg.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> "I'm sorry." That's all he ever says when he has to do this. But he doesn't mean it. I know he doesn't mean it.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A sits quietly for a moment. It reaches out and pets SCP-4889.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> They should be thanking me. I did more for them than they'll ever do for me.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A lifts its hands off of SCP-4889. It is still for approximately 20 seconds. SCP-4889-A shifts onto its knees and lowers its head. Mumbling is heard, but cannot be understood. It slowly bends down and holds its face in its hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Everything is still for approximately five minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A sharply inhales from its nose. SCP-4889 is visibly startled by this.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A draws a thin knife from its boot. It stabs the blade into SCP-4889.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889 screams.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> Stop. Please stop.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A places its free hand on SCP-4889 and begins carving through the muscle. SCP-4889 continues to scream, struggling to move.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> … Please just stop.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A pulls out chunks of muscle and organs from SCP-4889 while it shrieks. SCP-4889-A tugs the muscle away from their connective tissues and places a few pieces into its mouth. SCP-4889 screams louder.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> I said stop crying!</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A bats its fist down on SCP-4889's skull and neck four times, each time making contact with the stone it is resting on. It does not lift up its neck. SCP-4889-A sets down the meat on the stone and lifts up SCP-4889's head.</em></p>
<p><em>SCP-4889's cries are muffled by SCP-4889-A's closed fist. It beats on the skull ten more times.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4889-A:</strong> … I'm sorry.</p>
<p><em>SCP-4889-A lets go of SCP-4889 and it falls limp. SCP-4889-A resumes its previous position after 30 seconds. It looks at the viscera on the stone and hesitantly picks out a piece of flesh. It then proceeds to eat it slowly. While chewing, it carves out more meat from SCP-4889. This continues for approximately 39 minutes. SCP-4889 and SCP-4889-A are silent during this time.</em></p>
