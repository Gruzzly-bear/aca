            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-6601</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-6601 is to be hosted onto a D-class (D-5186 is the current host). The current host is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment unit. Direct contact from the current host to any person is not allowed. Performing relevant experiments requires the permission of at least one Level 3 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6601 is a sapient incorporeal entity. The subject is able to coexist with humans, but it is unknown whether this is necessary for it to survive. SCP-6601 has a mild temper, but can be insistent in terms of changing the host's memories.</p>
<p>Please refer to the discovery and addendums for details.</p>

<p><strong>Urgency:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Low</span> High</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<p>I am always proud of my eidetic memory, but one day, I found out that they are <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p>Combined with my work experience in the Foundation, I can't help but worry that this is an abnormal effect. Besides, I also went to the hospital for an examination, and I was able to confirm that there was no problem with my memory.</p>
<p>I remember clearly that I spent a very happy childhood with my parents in my hometown; but just when I was about to call my parents to greet them, I found out that my father had died before I was born. And my family apparently couldn't support the expenditure that I remember.</p>
<p>There are many things more serious and distinctive than these. In a word, the discrepancy between memory and reality makes me quite sure that my memory has been tampered <em>intentionally</em>. I feel uneasy at the thought of the possibilities behind it.</p>
<p>So I apply for and am willing to accept all the inspections of the Foundation.</p>
<p>I hope these are just because of my mental problems, because this is the most reassuring result.<br/>

Upon further examination, SCP-6601 was discovered using Dr. Li as a host.
<p>Dr. Li further reported that after the object was discovered, it was communicating with him by changing memories<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, and showed fear of being found. After Dr. Li tried to communicate with it in the way of reminiscence, SCP-6601 expressed its willingness to be interviewed by the Foundation.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum.6601-A - Interview results:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Foreword:</strong></em> SCP-6601 changed Dr. Li's memories throughout the process, leaving answers to the interviewer in Dr. Li's memories. Dr. Li spoke on its behalf.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. George</p>
<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Dr. Li (And SCP-6601)</p>
<p><strong>Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-6601 claimed that it has no malice.</li>
<li>SCP-6601 can be transferred through the host's physical contact with other human beings.</li>
<li>SCP-6601 claimed that the only effect it has on the host is to change the memories.</li>
<li>SCP-6601 claimed to be able to host onto all mammals, but favors humans.</li>
<li>SCP-6601 claimed to change Dr. Li's memories to "give him a happy childhood".</li>
</ul>
<p><em>[In the interview, Dr. George expressed doubts about the above statements.]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It is unknown whether SCP-6601 has any relatives(SCP-6601 began not to respond).</li>
<li>It is unknown how many humans SCP-6601 has hosted before.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Afterword:</strong> After further communication failed, SCP-6601 was forced to transfer from Dr. Li to D-5186 under the threat of executing Dr. Li.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some incorporeal entities that can change humans's memories are wandering around the world. What does it mean?</p>
<p>A person's spirit is entirely constructed from memories. As long as it is willing, it can subvert many things.</p>
<p>I propose to change the object to refer to its entire ethnic group, and reclassify it as Keter, and then take prompt action. After all, how can I make sure that it is not disguising? How can I make sure that it has no malicious relatives?<br/></p>

<p><strong>Addendum.6601.B - Researcher's notes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It left such a piece of paper on a desk in my memory before it left me. Every word on it is very clear imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>I have transcribed the original text here for reference. Please keep it.<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>- Dr. Li<br/>
<span style="color: white">Thank you very much.</span></p>

<p><em>I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused.</em></p>
<p><em>I'll start by answering the questions I wasn't able to answer because I was too scared: I don't know if I have relatives, I've never met any. As for this body, it is my 25843<sup>rd</sup> home.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, I can stay in my first home with peace of mind until her death, and then look for opportunities to move safely to the next place. But as you already know, I live in human memory; and I am affected by those memories.</em></p>
<p><em>Her childhood was miserable. She has never enjoyed the love of her family, and there is also unreasonable(at least I think so) discrimination and ridicule. Fear, uneasiness, melancholy, inferiority, all of these, shrouded in her whole childhood.</em></p>
<p><em>These directly affected her present moment. No one saw how she felt on the inside. No one. I can't figure out why other people treat her that way, and I can't figure out where the love and care she should have when she was a child went.</em></p>
<p><em>She saw a sentence in the book one day, and I was stung by that sentence: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"A lucky person's lifetime is cured by childhood, while an unlucky person's lifetime is spent curing childhood."</span></em></p>
<p><em>…I interfered. I gave her a happy childhood within the acceptable range.</em></p>
<p><em>She got better. A lot better, obviously better. That's it.</em></p>
<p><em>But, when I think that there may be more people like her before, I can't rest assured. Since then, I began to move frequently, trying my best to change and improve.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a pity… I tried too hard on this one. I made so many mistakes that I was discovered by you.</em></p>
<p><em>I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</em></p>
<p><em>But I have no regrets.</em></p>
