</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> When instances of SCP-7024 are found, they should be confiscated and moved to the nearest storage depot for less hazardous materials, for study and subsequent disposal. Depending on the storage capacity of each facility, at least 20% of the instances should be stored.</p>
<p>No active efforts of memetic suppression will be made to the subjects affected by SCP-7024, publicly attributing the associated events to casuistic or chance factors. For the cases in which these events have a high diffusion or notoriety, disinformation campaigns will be carried out, attributing them to unfounded rumors or hoaxes.</p>
<p>The efforts of the Foundation should be focused on the discovery of the SCP-7024 manufacturing facilities and the capture of the workers for their subsequent interrogation and amnestization. In cooperation with the local authorities, these facilities will be shut down on charges of serious health problems. Distributors will be traced for the confiscation of SCP-7024, preventing its commercialization.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update 1</span>: Upon discovery of a new SCP-7024 production site, a tactical team will be deployed to sabotage the machinery present and disable the site. These events should be covered up with fires, which will be reported as accidental (See Addendum 3.)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update 2</span>: If viable instances of SCP-7024-1 are found, their transport and delivery to the Druidic Secret Society will be coordinated through the Irish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (See Addendum 4.)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7024 corresponds to a compound with ontokinetic properties of lower intensity commercially distributed under the name of Lucky Cola. SCP-7024 has in its composition ingredients usually found in energy drinks such as caffeine, sucrose, amino acids such as taurine, and B vitamins together with wormwood extract (<em>Artemisia absinthium</em>). Other organic substances of biological origin have also been found, whose origin and composition have not yet been determined (See Addendum 2.)</p>

<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>An instance of SCP-7024.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-7024 has been described as "refreshing and energizing, with a slightly bitter aftertaste, similar to tonic water", without observing adverse effects other than those associated, after consuming large quantities, with the use of massive doses of caffeine and wormwood.</p>
<p>The anomalous effect associated with the use of SCP-7024 is related to the result of events with probabilistic outcomes in which the consumer participates, especially in relation to games or other activities whose rewards are not tangible, obtaining favorable results in a proportion much higher than what could be expected according to chance or to the consumer's abilities or skills.</p>
<p>Additionally, an increase in the frequency of events with negative or harmful outcomes has been observed among people in the family, social or work environment of SCP-7024 consumers, being the frequency and severity of these events directly proportional to the amounts consumed of SCP-7024, being originally many of these events associated to chance or to intentional actions on the part of SCP-7024 users.</p>
<p>The existence of SCP-7024 was discovered through the Foundation's automatic monitoring system of social networks, communications, and news CASANDRA, which upon detecting a series of unusual domestic accidents established that all the homes were inhabited by a subject who had recently obtained a victory in a sports or recreational competition. Seeking to rule out the presence of anomalous activities, ontokinetic, or the use of thaumaturgic rituals, these subjects were interviewed, establishing that the common factor was the use of SCP-7024 in a period close to the events described.</p>

<p>The following is a transcript of an interview with an SCP-7024 user, describing events that affected the subject and his family group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> Tony Frati, 55 years old, an accountant from the city of ████████████<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Geronimo Bozo, police officer from ████████████.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Preamble:</strong> Mr. Frati went to the ████████████ city police station on 20/09/21 to make a complaint against the casino █████████████████ for possible criminal actions against his family. The complaint was received by Agent Geronimo Bozo, of the State Police ████████████, and the recording obtained was delivered to the Foundation through a collaborating agent.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&lt;BEGINNING OF RECORDING, [20-09-2021, 12:05 hrs]&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Agent Bozo:</strong> Good afternoon. Tell me, how can I help you?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati:</strong> I didn't think they were capable but those damn bastards did it. They just can't accept someone getting lucky and beating them fair and square, no, no sir, because they're cheaters they think everyone cheats.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Agent Bozo:</strong> Excuse me?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati:</strong> The casino people. They cleanly fleece whoever they can but if someone beats them they go ballistic. What I wonder is how they were able to get to her to hurt her (starts sobbing).<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Agent Bozo:</strong> Calm down, please explain to me what happened.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati (takes a deep breath):</strong> Excuse me, I think I started in the middle. What happened is that a while ago I won some money from the casino and apparently because they think I cheated and they couldn't prove it, they retaliated against my wife.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati:</strong> I've always liked to gamble, although I never do it in large amounts (smiles). The night of September 7th I went to the casino to spend a few dollars, and yes sir, that was my night. I started with roulette and turned 200 into 1000. Then I went to the Blackjack table and won hand after hand, I folded when I hit 30k.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Agent Bozo:</strong> Between you and me, did you cheat?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati:</strong> Of course not, I'm a Presbyterian, cheating is a sin. I don't drink alcohol either, I only drink energy drinks. That night I drank several cans of the only non-alcoholic thing they had, a soda called Lucky Cola. It's a greenish shit, kind of bitter but very refreshing, I liked it so much that I took several cans home with me.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati:</strong> That night I played until about 3 or 4 AM, I was winning but I was afraid of losing everything, so I went to change the chips. When I got to the cashier and cashed out I was held and taken to the monitoring room. The head of security told me that I was no longer welcome, that my access to the casino was forbidden from that day on. I saw distrust and confusion in his eyes, he was trying to understand how I had cheated, they simply could not accept that I had been lucky.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati:</strong> I went back home and the next day I decided to spend some of that money that fell from the sky (smiles) to buy a new van for Maria, my wife, her old truck was barely working and every day she has to commute an hour to work. If you could have seen how happy she was when we went to pick it up. It was brand new, fresh from the dealer…</p>
<p><strong>Tony Frati:</strong> We went out to test it on a nearby road. It was running perfectly, didn't make any strange noises, and just before reaching a junction the steering locked up, we went through an intersection and ended up being hit by a car coming in the opposite direction. The impact was on the driver's side, I was unhurt but my wife got the worst part.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Tony Frati:</strong> I have been in the hospital with her, she regained consciousness a few days ago. Fortunately, her head is fine but she suffered multiple fractures and the doctors don't know if she will ever walk again.<br/>
<br/>
I have given it a lot of thought and I can't help but think that the casino people did something to the van so that we would have an accident. But how did they know we would buy that vehicle from that place? And how could they sabotage it? Either that or that money was cursed. It's like all my good fortune is gone in one fell swoop.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;END OF RECORD, [20-09-2021, 12:30 hrs.]&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>CLOSING STATEMENT:</strong> Foundation technical personnel were able to access the wreckage of the wrecked vehicle, finding no signs of malicious tampering on any of the van's components. Subsequent analysis determined that the accident was attributable to a very rare spontaneous failure of the hydraulic system, not detected in the quality control tests.</p>

<p>Through interviews with distributors, it was determined that the compound was produced in the U.S. by a company called Irish Charm Ltd. Although it was possible through a front company to acquire a batch of 100 cans of 350 ml of SCP-7024, the first attempts to find the production plant was unsuccessful, not locating the indicated address or only finding disused industrial rooms. The use of paratechnology was required so that an exploration team could access this plant and make a record of its production activities.</p>
<p><strong>Participating team:</strong> Members of MTF Lambda-6 ("Snoopers")</p>
<p><strong>Participating personnel:</strong> Captain Mario Gutiérrez (Lambda-1), Agent Ali Salmad (Lamda-2), Agent Barry Boyle (Lambda-3)</p>

<strong>&lt;[15-01-2022, 18:09 hrs]&gt;</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> Guys, this is the last building we need to inspect today. Activate your DELFOS; I don't want to encounter any unpleasant surprises.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-3:</strong> OK Captain, although I doubt we can even enter the place, it's about to collapse, it looks like it's been abandoned since the prohibition era. Can't hear any noise from inside or see any steam coming out of the chimneys.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-2:</strong> Shall I go inspect if there are any service entrances?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> No (reconfigures his DELFOS equipment to a different wavelength) How interesting. We have the entrance right in front of us, covered with camouflage glyphs.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-3:</strong> Do you think we have any thaumaturgists on site?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> I doubt it, you can learn how to draw those things on the internet, most likely they're just some junkies who want to cook meth without anyone sticking their nose in.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-3:</strong> Anyway, so far the only abnormal thing we've found in the inspections are the abnormally large and hungry rats living in those abandoned factories, let's check this dump fast to get back to base.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1 (communicating by radio):</strong> Video transmission activated, we're going in.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-2:</strong> This place looks a lot bigger than I expected. It also looks pretty clean, like they've been using it until recently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lambda-1:</strong> Look what we have here (points his camera at some stainless steel tanks) either someone is reviving Grandpa's illegal whiskey business or we've finally found the factory. I can report that there are sounds of machinery running and steam coming out of at least one of the tanks, but so far we don't see any of the operators.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Control:</strong> Shall we send a support team?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> No, we have our weapons ready if hostiles are present, also in the worst situation we will proceed to evacuate the compound.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Control:</strong> Copy that.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-2:</strong> Do you feel that smell? It's like a decoction of medicinal herbs with a rat smell? monkey smell? shit smell? I don't know, it's like a beast smell.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> I don't think it's relevant, let's keep checking.<br/>
<br/>
<em>(they find crates with sacks of sugar and dried grass, plus other components they can't identify, they take samples for further analysis.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>(while checking another storage cellar, a loud noise is heard and steam and an amorphous mass of debris come out of one of the tanks, being carried by a nearby conveyor belt to a trash container.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> This is getting more and more interesting…<br/>
<br/>
<em>(they continue with the search of the place, accessing a warehouse with apparently several hundred units of SCP-7024.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-2:</strong> This appears to be the finished product storage warehouse. There's something that has me concerned. We've been what, 10 minutes, checking the place and so far we haven't seen any workers, it's impossible that the plant is fully automated.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-3 (approaching):</strong> Hey, I followed one of the scrap carts and it emptied into the top of a warehouse, the door is padlocked, it seems to me that's too much security for a simple dump.</p>
<p><em>(the three operatives approach the warehouse, and Lamdba-2 manages using a lock pick to open the door. They find several piles of boiled grass and peeking out of one of those piles they see the partially heat-destroyed remains of a small quadrupedal animal with a large skull.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-2:</strong> Oh shit, it looks like they boiled a rat, that's disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
<em>(they continue exploring the place, finding some offices with binders of accounting records and more warehouses with raw materials and packaging materials. They pass through the packaging section, where the SCP-7024 canning process occurs seemingly automatically. Hearing cries of distress coming from a warehouse at the far end of the plant, they head over, picking the lock to gain entry. Inside they find dozens of small-sized cages, several of which have small animals of an undetermined species inside, which are in varying degrees of agitation.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-2:</strong> Oh shit, what are those things, they look like little monkeys. I think this is where the stench of beasts we've been feeling all this time comes from.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-3:</strong> Since when are monkeys green? Also, those things are whimpering, I don't know if we should call an animal recovery team from the Foundation or Wilson's guys, I'm not a zoologist but I know those are not capuchins.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> Listen good, they're not whimpering… it's like they're singing a funeral dirge. Fuck, that's really macabre.<br/>
<br/>
<em>(Lambda-1 approaches one of the cages, crouching down.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> What can we do for you, little buddy?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Entity 1:</strong> Cob…hair. Cobhair.</p>
<p><strong>Lambda-1:</strong> Cobhair?</p>
<p><strong>Entity 1 (shaking its head):</strong> He..lp.<br/>
<br/>
<em>(at that moment a hatch opens from the ceiling, and a mechanical crane grabs the cage, lifting it up and carrying it quickly to the outside, moments later the sound of steam rising and screams of pain can be heard.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Lambda-1:</strong> Oh shit.<br/>
<br/>
<em>(several subjects appear in the doorway, wearing work clothes and carrying shovels and other heavy tools.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Subject 1:</strong> Fuck me… What the hell are they doing here?<br/>
<br/>
<em>(the subjects rush towards the agents and Lambda-1 proceeds to shoot them with his service weapon, being hit in the head by one of the attackers. Lambda-2 and Lambda-3 also open fire on the attackers, with several of the cages being kicked and overturned during the struggle, allowing several specimens of the unknown entity to flee the scene. Video contact is lost a few seconds later.)</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Epilogue:</strong> A tactical response team from the nearest Site arrived 30 minutes later at the scene, finding no trace of Agents Gutierrez, Salmad, and Boyle or the attackers involved in the incident. Three instances of the unknown biological entity were recovered in the vicinity, along with the remains of at least a dozen cooked and partially dehydrated individuals. The instances were housed in the Bioterium of Site-██<br/></p>

<li><strong>Letter from the Department of Foreign Affairs of Ireland</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>June 6, 2022.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Through a high-level liaison of the Foundation it has come to our attention that they have, under their control, three instances of a species of cryptofauna belonging to the Republic of Ireland, specimens which I must acknowledge, with great regret, where along with many others taken by citizens of our country who, blinded by greed, have been capable not only of jeopardizing a balance we have maintained with the magical world for centuries but also the very well-being of the country itself.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Those innocent creatures that you called (creatively I must admit.) as Cebus viridis cantor, we have known from at least the Middle Ages as Leprechauns, being protected for a very long time by a select group of men who knew ancient secrets. It was these same men who at the time preferred to form a black legend around the Leprechauns so that they would be left alone. For the welfare of these creatures is literally our welfare, and if they are happy, luck will be with us and Ireland will prosper.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>On other occasions, event with regret, we have collaborated with you in the containment and even neutralization of other creatures of anomalous origin with which we had coexisted for centuries but which simply did not adapt to modern times, getting out of control, becoming noxious and unnecessarily attracting the attention of the world to our land.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>On this occasion I ask you, on behalf of the Irish government just the opposite. That you return these creatures to us so that they can return to live happily in the special corner of Ireland where they belong, a place unknown to most people. Because if they disappear, so will we.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Hoping for your cooperation and that we do not have to resort to force majeure measures to achieve our goal I take my best regards,</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defense of the Republic of Ireland.</em></p>
