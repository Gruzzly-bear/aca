<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-8979 is to be securely stored in a standard containment locker within Area-189 when not actively being utilized for testing or research purposes.</p>
<p>SCP-8979-1 has been deemed non-hostile and poses no direct threat. As such, SCP-8979-1 is granted restricted access to certain Foundation facilities, including the Sector-B6 cafeteria and recreational areas at Area-189. Interaction between SCP-8979-1 and Foundation personnel is permitted, provided it is under the supervision of Level-2 staff or higher.</p>
<p>Any recreational drug use by SCP-8979-1 must be monitored closely and is only allowed in designated, pre-approved recreational zones. Any attempts by SCP-8979-1 to encourage Foundation staff to participate in such activities must be promptly reported and will result in disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8979 is a standard black cassette tape with a handwritten label reading "Unreleased Eazy-E Demo." It was recovered in ██████, California, during a covert Foundation operation in 20██. The cassette appears to contain previously unreleased recordings attributed to the late rapper Eric "Eazy-E" Wright, co-founder of N.W.A. However, when played on any standard audio device, the tape does not produce music, but instead summons SCP-8979-1.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>SCP-8979-1 is a humanoid entity that manifests as an exact physical and behavioral replica of Eric "Eazy-E" Wright in his mid-20s. SCP-8979-1 wears typical West Coast hip-hop attire from the 1990s. Despite Wright’s death in 1995, SCP-8979-1 exhibits no signs of aging or decomposition and behaves as if fully alive.</p>
<p>Upon manifestation, SCP-8979-1 typically engages in musical performances, conversations, or social activities with Foundation personnel. SCP-8979-1 displays a relaxed, charismatic personality, using slang and expressions associated with Wright. Interestingly, it expresses admiration for the Foundation's work, often referring to containment operations as "serious business" and "keeping things real."</p>
<p>SCP-8979-1 has shown a strong interest in Foundation operations. Under supervision, it has been allowed to observe low-priority meetings and occasionally provides feedback. Although SCP-8979-1's comments are delivered casually, they have offered surprisingly valuable insights into containment strategies.</p>
<p>Despite performing music similar to Eazy-E's classic style with modern elements, SCP-8979-1's performances cannot be recorded. Any attempts to capture the audio, either digitally or analog, have failed, with the music vanishing once the performance ends. SCP-8979-1 appears unbothered by this, often stating that its music is "for the moment."</p>
<p>In addition to its performances, SCP-8979-1 enjoys casual interactions with Foundation staff, often participating in games or conversations in the Area-189 cafeteria. Its laid-back demeanor and positive attitude have made SCP-8979-1 popular among lower-level personnel, contributing to improved staff morale. It remains cooperative with containment protocols and shows no signs of hostility or intent to undermine the Foundation’s mission.</p>
<p>Though SCP-8979-1 is aware of its “resurrection” and past life, it shows no distress regarding its current state. When questioned, SCP-8979-1 typically responds with phrases like "It is what it is" or "I'm just here, chillin’."</p>
<p>Research into SCP-8979 and SCP-8979-1 has not yet determined how the cassette’s anomalous properties are connected to Eric Wright’s life or death. Current theories suggest that SCP-8979-1 may be an advanced auditory-based construct, created from thaumaturgic or psychological imprints of Wright. Alternatively, SCP-8979 might be an anomalous object capable of fabricating human personas. Ongoing research into media-based anomalies seeks to identify possible connections.</p>
<p>No known ties between SCP-8979 and any groups of interest have been found, though investigation into its origin in ██████, California, is still pending.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> SCP-8979-1 only manifests when the cassette is played in its entirety. If the tape is stopped or paused before it finishes, SCP-8979-1 dematerializes immediately. When not in use, SCP-8979 exhibits no anomalous properties.</p>
<p>SCP-8979-1 shows no adverse effects from frequent or prolonged manifestations, though sessions lasting longer than six hours have led SCP-8979-1 to voluntarily dematerialize, citing the need to "take a break."</p>

<p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-8979-1 observed a containment strategy meeting, supervised by Level-3 personnel. During a discussion on SCP-████, SCP-8979-1 suggested an alternative approach to communication with the entity. This led to a productive discussion that resulted in minor adjustments to the containment procedures of several humanoid anomalies. Senior staff noted SCP-8979-1’s input as "unexpectedly insightful."</p>

<p>On ██/██/20██, SCP-8979-1 participated in a rap battle with junior researchers in the Area-189 Sector-B6 cafeteria. Observers described the performance as "legendary," though all attempts to record it failed, as expected. Following this event, staff morale significantly improved, with several employees noting that SCP-8979-1’s approachable nature had a positive impact on their well-being.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> What's up, Doc? What's all this equipment for? Not everyday you talk with tha Hip Hop Thugsta himself?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> Thank you for joining us, SCP-8979-1. I’d like to ask you a few questions today, if that’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> For sure, for sure. Just call me Eazy, though. All this number talk is whack. Let’s get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> Noted. Eazy, do you understand where you are and what this place is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Hell yeah, I know what’s up. Y’all got some kinda secret operation goin’ on here, keepin’ the world in check and all that. I ain’t trippin'. I respect what y’all do. You keepin' some real dangerous shit locked up—gangsta shit. And now, you got me on the track, too. Guess that makes me a part of it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> Interesting perspective. Can you tell me what you remember before you first appeared here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Man, I dunno exactly how it went down. One minute, I’m chillin’, just doin’ my thing, and the next, bam, I’m back here. Ain’t no big thing. You play that tape, and here I am, ready to drop some heat. It’s all love, though. I ain’t mad about it. What’s done is done.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> So you're aware of your death?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Oh, I know, Doc. AIDS took me out, yeah. But now? I guess death ain’t the end of the road for Eazy. I got more to say, more to spit. So here I am, resurrected or whatever y’all call it. Like I said, it is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> How do you feel about your current state? Being summoned through a cassette tape and not being able to leave until it's played?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> It’s kinda fly, ain’t it? Like, I'm the real deal, but I ain't out here wildin' out like a ghost or some shit. I just do me when I’m around, give y’all some bars, drop knowledge, hang out with the homies in the cafeteria. Honestly, I don’t even need to be everywhere. Let the tape play, and I’m good. No complaints here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> Can you explain how your music works? We've been unable to record any of your performances.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> That’s the magic right there. You can’t catch what’s raw like that. You gotta be in the moment, feel it live. Ain’t no need to record it ‘cause it ain’t for the world—it's for the people right there when it’s goin’ down. Eazy-E live and direct, baby. That’s somethin’ special, and it’s for y’all only. Kinda like an exclusive show, you dig?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> But there’s no way to capture it? No recordings, no reproductions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Nah, man. That ain’t how it rolls. You can try all your fancy tech, but when I’m done, that shit’s gone like it never even happened. It’s like magic, thaumaturgy or how y'all call it, but cooler. Y’all just gotta vibe with it while it’s happenin'. I guess that’s how I’m built now.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> Does it bother you that your music can’t be shared beyond these performances?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Naw, Doc, it’s all good. I already made my mark. Everybody knows what I did. This? This is just for you and the crew. Like a private concert for the homies at the Foundation. You lucky, you know? Not everybody gets that.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> You seem very cooperative with our containment procedures. Are you satisfied with your situation here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Yeah, I mean, y’all treat me right. Got good food, some chill cats to hang with, and y’all ain’t tryna lock me in a box or nothin’. You let me do my thing. Ain’t nobody disrespectin’ me, so we cool. Long as I get to drop some rhymes now and then, I’m straight.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> And what about your interactions with Foundation personnel? You seem to enjoy their company.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Oh, for sure. These cats? They cool with me. Some of 'em know what’s up, they know the music, respect the legacy. Others, they just like hangin' with a real OG, you feel me? I don’t mind, though. I like keepin’ it light, keepin’ folks smilin'. Y’all got a tough gig here, so why not bring some vibes, you know? Hell, I even kicked it with that alien dude—SCP-6118, right? Man, I ain't gonna lie, that lil' homie’s been through some real messed up shit. I could feel it. Dude’s got a heavy load on his shoulders, and I ain’t just talkin’ ‘bout all that trauma stuff, nah—I mean the real trauma, deep in his head.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> We chopped it up a bit. I tried to tell him, 'Life’s a b*tch, but you gotta roll with it, ya feel me?' Didn’t seem like he was ready to hear that, though. Dude's all twisted up inside, from everything he's been through. It’s rough seein' that, especially when it looks like he ain’t never had nobody on his side. Still, I gave him some of my time, let him know if he ever wanna talk, I’m here. Ain't much I can do, but sometimes just listenin’ helps. You know me—I’m about keepin' it cool, and if I can help the homies here chill out a little, I’m down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> That’s interesting, Eazy. I didn’t realize you’d had the chance to interact with SCP-6118. What was that like for you? It’s not every day you’re face-to-face with something—or someone—so vastly different from what you're used to.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Yeah, no doubt. I mean, it was different for sure. I’ve seen all kinds of folks in my time, but I never thought I’d be choppin' it up with an alien, you feel me? But at the end of the day, pain is pain, no matter where you come from—Earth, Kepler, or wherever that lil’ dude’s from. You can see it in his eyes, too. I know that look; been around people who got that same look, like the world done ‘em dirty.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> He’s been through it—kinda like how some folks get chewed up by the streets, but this was on a whole other level. It’s like he ain't just fightin' what came from his government, but everything that's in his head, too. I tried to drop some words on him, but… I don’t think he can really hear anybody right now. And I don't think he would like if I continued.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> Understood. Proceeding with the interview. One last question—do you have any desires or requests while you're here?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Nah, I’m good. Y’all already takin’ care of me. Maybe just keep bringin’ me around when you need me, let me do what I do best. And if you ever wanna kick back and hear some real West Coast classics, you know where to find me. Ain’t nothin’ else I really need. It’s all love, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Anna:</strong> Thank you for your time, Eazy. This has been very informative.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-8979-1:</strong> Anytime, Doc. You cool with me. Peace out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note from Dr. Anna:</strong> <em>Interaction between SCP-8979-1 and SCP-6118 has been allowed on a bi-weekly basis. SCP-8979-1 actually got SCP-6118 to open about its past, so that's useful.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note from Dr. Filip:</strong><br/>
<em>While SCP-8979-1 does not present any immediate risk to containment, his interactions should remain controlled and within low-security environments. Continued observation of SCP-8979-1's behavior is recommended to ensure that his presence does not interfere with normal operations.</em></p>
