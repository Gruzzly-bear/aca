<p>A manifestation of SCP-8709.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-8709 is a emergent property of a supercomputer program known as the DEPTHS Project, appearing as a 25 meter tall black, non-reflective structure. The composition of the entity is comparable to boids,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> stimulating a quantum entanglement state that fluctuates within reality. SCP-8709 uses this phenomena to trans-locate to any locale around the world, with primary functionality including monitoring system resources and scenario progression. These manifestations of SCP-8709 have caused significant destabilization at each site, generating powerful black body radiation<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> detectable from up to 10 kilometers away. Constant tracking of these conditions has allowed for anticipation of the next materialization sites within the range of 24 hours.</p>
<p>Upon manifesting, SCP-8709 will enter an active state; turning on high-intensity light that emits brief omnidirectional flashing at 2 to 3 rotations per second that lasts for 4 hours. These long exposures subject large areas to ionizing radiation of 25 - 30 mSv<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> per rotation, causing substantial physical and psychological phenomena. This intermittent photic simulation triggers a condition closely relating to photosensitive epilepsy, with subjects unable to recall their activities during the manifestation. Recovered recordings show individuals conducting normal activities while themselves and surrounding structures are continuously atomized then reconstructed from SCP-8709's photo-radiation. Further examination of these sites also exhibited extensive transformations of the locale, with several objects and occupants composed of abnormal matter, indicating reoccurring data reconstruction errors. These changes only occur within 10 kilometers of the SCP-8709 manifestation, showing a severe but limited effect on the immediate area.</p>
<p>During contact with SCP-8709, pronounced radio signals were captured matching coded transmissions to the Foundation. These signals were being transferred to a terminal at site-09, an underwater facility located in the Horizon Deep. The terminal, designated Y2K, is a Hewlett-Packard VT2640 that has been heavily retrofitted to perform complex quantum computations and P2P networking<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup>, and was used for communication with the entity. Over the course of 72 hours, testing was conducted to isolate the signal, leading to the discovery of SCP-8709's wireless access point and the collection of various scenario data from SCP-8709. For security purposes, the terminal was secluded on a closed interoperable network with several Cerberus firewalls before connecting to SCP-8709's mainframe.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8709-2: The DEPTHS Project</strong></p>
<p>Upon gaining access to the mainframe, multiple mentions of the DEPTHS Project were uncovered, initiating an inquiry into the project's ongoing activities at Site-09. The project was developed in the early 1980s , initiated by the SCP Foundation due to the increasing frequency and severity of anomalous disasters, particularly the "White Fire" event in 1978. Prompting the need for a comprehensive multi-level evaluation, a quantum computational matrix was engineered for simulating and analyzing hypothetical XK class scenarios. The onboard artificial intelligence , Aeon, oversees the analytics, pinpointing potential hypo-centers for each simulated event. As outlined in DEPTHS documentation, failure to manage an event triggers a system reboot, reverting the simulation to a prior state to initiate a new cycle under comparable conditions. Each cycle has the potential for a branch to form. Known as "branching," this phenomenon occurs when a DEPTHS simulation successfully integrates into an existing computational framework. This process results in a layered or nested simulation environment, facilitating the coalescence and interaction of multiple simulated realities within a singular matrix.</p>
<p>The branching mechanism is intricate and dynamic, drawing upon advanced quantum computing principles, algorithms, and predictive analytics to coordinate the interconnected layers. Each branch presents a unique scenario, creating an expansive platform for various XK class simulations and their prospective outcomes across a potentially infinite continuum. The "depth" of these branches signifies their positioning relative to the baseline reality, encapsulating layers of interlinked simulations, each characterized by its distinct parameters and outcomes. Each subsequent branch serves as a pivotal nexus within these groupings and should a preceding branch fail or be terminated (KUT)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>, it would trigger a collapse of the associated realities, setting off a chain reaction throughout the simulated framework.</p>
<p>SCP-8709's designation will vary based on a realities progression, alternatively recognized as SCP-001, the Avatar of a Broken God, or the Tower. These deviations seen within SCP-8709’s archive suggest accumulating differences leading to significant historical deviations, alterations in the laws of physics, or the emergence of fantastical elements, among other possibilities. Given the inherent unpredictability of quantum mechanics, the simulations archived within SCP-8709 display intrinsic instability, presenting as inconsistencies or "glitches” within the computational matrix.</p>
<p>The program has encountered significant setbacks, with 56% of scenarios failing to complete due to state fidelity issues or quantum decoherence. To address these issues, SCP-8709 has integrated synchronized error correction, utilizing scans from alternate realities to provide real-time updates to its simulated counterpart. Since the discovery of SCP-8709, a consistent frequency decline of 2.8Hz per synchronization attempt has been observed, with the universe's frequency dropping from 963Hz to 837Hz, signaling progressive deterioration. Drawing parallels between the project's AI, SCP-8709's operations, and the connection to terminal Y2K, it is speculated that SCP-8709 is a manifestation of an ongoing simulation of the baseline reality. Efforts to halt the synchronization process, establish self containment via severance from the matrix and stabilization of the current simulated state are currently in progress as the c-(kenoma) virus under the supervision of Dr. Abraham Wright.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8709-3: The c-(kenoma) virus</strong></p>
<p>The c-(kenoma) virus was developed by the SCP Foundation as an oncoviral agent<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup>, used to infect SCP-8709's program thereby prompting a "KUT" command and creating an equilibrium state within the simulated environment. In theory, isolation from the computational matrix would prevent the controlled cyclical collapse and allow for a continued existence within a self contained pocket.</p>
<p>The precise mechanics of the virus's interaction with an object undergoing quantum deterioration is unclear. Given SCP-8709's self-correcting properties, it is unknown how it will interpret the viral intrusion and instead may cause irreversible damage to the program. There is a strong indication that data integrity would also be effected, compromising input memory, reality structuring parameters or critical scenario progression. This would lead to a greater entropy factor, making long term predictions and overall stability difficult to anticipate.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8709-4: Email from Dr. Wright to O5 Council</strong></p>
<p><strong>Forward:</strong> To date, this email has only been found in 34% of the simulations reviewed.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>Title: A Concern<br/>
Date: November 23, 1998</p>
<p>To: The O5 Council</p>
<p>When the body is afflicted by a disease or abnormality, it will - without thought or hesitation- begin the process of defending itself. It will instinctively use every resource it can to save itself even if it may result in self destruction.</p>
<p>Is our development of the virus an emergent property of the deterioration or an unintended consequence of adaptive subroutines? Is what we are doing an exercise of free will or an extension of SCP-8709's?</p>
<p>Is there a we? Or just an it?</p>
<p>I wish to renew my objections on using the c-(kenoma) virus on SCP-8709. We don't know enough about the adaptive properties of the program nor the extent of the systemic instability. I cannot in good conscience continue with this intervention without more information. I am formally requesting more time and additional resources before we proceed. This is our one and only chance, there can be no mistakes.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Addendum SCP-8709-5: Infection</strong></p>
<p>On December 1, 1998, SCP-8709 contracted the c-(kenoma) virus following an extra-dimensional incursion of a arboreal instance of SCP-8709. This event resulted in both entities becoming spatially locked off the coast of Hilton Head, South Carolina. Subsequently, these instances have been reclassified as SCP-8709-1 and SCP-8709-2.</p>
<p>The infection has induced a conjoining between SCP-8709-1 and SCP-8709-2, leading to the development of branchial growths at a rate of 0.9 meters per day. Significant mutation of the boids have coalesced into a fractal-like structure, spreading across the surface and subsurface of both instances. As it progresses, subsequent simulations have been observed undergoing a similar conversion, suggesting the consolidation of multiple scenarios infected by the c-(kenoma) virus. It is believed that the other realities SCP Foundations , in response to their own deterioration, developed their own instances of the virus in order to trigger a severance between connected simulations and halt destabilization. However, due to the crossover event, this has resulted in a wide spread systemic failure within the interconnected virtual environments, resulting in the merger of multiple SCP-8709 and simulations into a single, corrupted matrix.</p>
<p>Due to this, SCP-8709-1’s data reconstruction capabilities have been severely compromised, with the affected locale exhibiting non-Euclidean spaces, conceptual cross-contamination, temporal paradoxes, and overlapping XK-class events. Attempts to correct systematic errors through the synchronization process have resulted in computational feedback loops, accelerating the destabilization of SCP-8709-1 and SCP-8709-2. These feedback loops have increased the spread of branchial growths and associated anomalies, leading to minor aberrations escalating into major breaches of containment.</p>
<p>Current systemic collapse estimated in 428 days.</p>
