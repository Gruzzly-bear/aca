<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-2651-A is to be placed in a hemispherical recess in a containment chamber at <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32">Lunar Area-32</a>. This chamber will be outfitted with two <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2176">Kardec Counters</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, security cameras, and a microphone. The devices will be checked on a weekly basis, with repairs being made if necessary. If any equipment becomes irreparable, it must be requested to be part of the next scheduled supply delivery. Drains and a sprinkler system will be built into the chamber to remove any bodily fluids released by SCP-2651-B instances and SCP-2651-C. Once removed the fluids will be stored in biohazard storage tanks for analysis or will be disposed.</p>
<p>All observed 2651-SKIA Events have been performed identically. However, if any discrepancies are observed, these must be recorded and reported to Level 3/2651 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2651 is the collective designation for a metal sphere (SCP-2651-A) surrounded by a set of ectoplasmic entities<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> of extraterrestrial origin (SCP-2651-B and SCP-2651-C).</p>
<p>SCP-2651-A is composed of a rhodium-platinum alloy, possessing a radius of 71.7cm. The sphere depicts a landscape resembling current models of Earth's geography during the late Neoproterozoic Era<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup>, with the outlines of continents and islands engraved on the surface. Notable deviations from the models are three circular islands off the west coast of the minor supercontinent Proto-Laurasia and a ring-shaped lake on the East Antarctic Shield. The circular islands, the lake, and several other locations on the globe have what appears to be a stylized rendition of SCP-2651-B instances on them (Pictogram 1). Electrical hums and other mechanical noises emanate from SCP-2651-A, indicating an interior structure, though the globe's outer surface has blocked sonar imaging attempts.</p>
<p>SCP-2651-B1 through SCP-2651-B10 float in a circular pattern around SCP-2651-A, at a distance of approximately 1m. Limitations with Kardec Counters prevent a full analysis of the anatomy of SCP-2651-B instances, though general details have been ascertained:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each entity has a 1m tall upright conical body, with the main body and each limb segmented in a manner similar to arthropods. The body is divided into three sections.</li>
<li>Connected to the base of the body are four legs ending in circular feet.</li>
<li>On the body's midsection are six tendrils, each 3m long and ending in a claw.</li>
<li>Four conical protrusions are on the top of the body, likely a form of sensory organ.</li>
<li>A set of mandibles are on the bottom of the cone.</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-2651-B7 is the only entity to possess numerous apparent tumorous growths on its body.</p>
<p>Aside from movement around SCP-2651-A, the entities are largely inactive when not experiencing a 2651-SKIA Event. Normal activity consists of repeated convulsions, spasms of the limbs, and erratic mandible clicks. The only instance to not behave in this manner is SCP-2651-B7, which is motionless and limp.</p>
<p>SCP-2651-C floats approximately 1m above SCP-2651-A. The body is similar to that of SCP-2651-B, though the top body section is replaced with a large spherical object. This "head" sphere frequently changes its shape, denting to form symbols from a dialect of the Ortothan Extraterrestrial Language (OEL)<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> and creating patterns of holes that can vocalize. When not experiencing a 2651-SKIA Event, SCP-2651-C behaves the same way as SCP-2651-B instances. Frequently the phrases "myself failed" and "myself knew not" manifest on the sphere.</p>
<p>Seven times a year a 2651-SKIA Event will occur, in which SCP-2651-B instances and SCP-2651-C will reenact a ritual. This ritual is presumed to have been initially performed in the far past, during the creation of SCP-2651, though details on the event are lacking. Refer to the addendum for further information.</p>
<div class="scp-image-block block-right" style="width:300px;"><img alt="lunar-tunnel.png" class="image" src="https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2651/lunar-tunnel.png"/>
<div class="scp-image-caption">
<p>The tunnel leading from the cavern.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-2651 was accidentally discovered on 13-February-2017 during the construction of the Area <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2226">13</a>-32 Transit System. The boring machine in use was shut down when miners created an entrance to a previously unknown large cavern, hemispherical in shape (radius of ~35m). Signs of anomalous activity were reported, and Mobile Task Force Gamma-4 ("Blondebeard's Crew") was dispatched for preliminary containment.</p>
<p>At the time of discovery the cavern floor was covered in a 2m high slurry of organic matter and a pink blood-like fluid (hereafter referred to as haemorozin), likely having built up from repeated 2651-SKIA Events since the anomaly's creation. SCP-2651-A had been placed on a metal pedestal and was partially submerged in the fluids. Surrounding the pedestal were seven statues resembling SCP-2651-B instances, built from a black metal. Of note is that the number of tendrils on each statue ranged from one to seven. A smaller globe depicting the surface of the moon was also found, engraved with Pictogram 1 on multiple sections.</p>
<p>The area was then drained, uncovering pieces of blue-green colored exoskeletons similar to the apparent exoskeletons on SCP-2651-B and SCP-2651-C. Puncture wounds, damage consistent with blunt force trauma, and embedded bullet-shaped objects were present on many pieces. Mechanical devices resembling guns, engraved with unidentified thaumaturgic runes, were also found in varying damaged states.</p>
<p>Placed next to SCP-2651-A was AO-2651-1, a 2m<sup>3</sup> explosive device. Within the device is a cylindrical capsule constructed from a type of exotic matter, determined with <a href="/2117-recovered-materials">technology recovered from SCP-2117</a> to contain 10g of liquid antimatter. After receiving a signal, a mechanism would break this case and cause the liquid to undergo matter/antimatter annihilation with all matter in the surrounding region, creating a violent explosion that would likely destroy all objects in the cavern. The mechanism appears to have been in the process of breaking the case, though large amounts of dried organic matter had entered the device and halted the process.</p>
<p>Attached to two adjacent statues is a long diagonal structure, composed of chunks of blue-green exoskeleton and solidified material resembling muscle tissues. The structure forms the following sentence in OEL:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Unknown Symbol 16] helping. The Holies<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> receive the blood. [Unknown Symbol 16] bleeds (forever?).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the top of a slope within the cavern is an entrance to a 20m long tunnel. Apparent entrances to other chambers are present along the sides of the tunnel, though all were blocked from cave-ins and black metal barriers. At the end of the tunnel is a room meant to serve as an airlock, left nonfunctional by explosion damage that had broken the pressurization systems. On the other side of the airlock is a mechanical lift that leads up a 3km shaft to a metal hatch. Based on the location of the transit system tunnel, task force agents were able to locate the hatch on the lunar surface, which had been covered in a layer of sediment and was welded shut. A metal plaque is attached to it, possessing OEL sentences in diagonal line patterns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Message of [Pictogram 1] Holy Defense Legion</p>
<p>[Unknown Yellow Symbol] hazards. The not-god(?) lied here. Entrance is treason to the Koru-teusa and the Fourth World. Warrants [Unknown Symbol 22]-absorption death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 19-February-2017, SCP-2651 and AO-2651-1 were brought into containment at Lunar Area-32. Construction was resumed the following day, with the course of the tunnel altered to prevent potential damage to the cavern.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Yourselves do not feel sorrow. Yourselves mortal forms(?) will be gone but yourselves feel jubilant to watch over and bring prosperity to people, culture, army, the new Fourth World.</p>
<p><em>The rods slice two of the claws on each entity off, causing haemorozin to spill out of region of the wound. They begin to walk around SCP-2651-A, creating a complex geometric pattern on the ground with the haemorozin.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Yourselves lose fear of becoming pure spirits.</p>
<p><em>The instances stop moving and stand still at their original positions, with the exception of SCP-2651-B7. A crack appears next to one of their legs and a set of clawless, bleeding appendages emerges from it. The appendages move down the leg and create a series of symbols stylistically different from the main pattern. The appendages quickly retract before SCP-2651-C starts clicking.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Stare above.</p>
<p><em>The rods position themselves in front of each entity and rapidly penetrate through their middle body segments.

<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Stare above, forget yourselves bodies, forget the rocks surrounding and stare through the moon. Guide your spirits out into the black void and stare. [Unknown Symbol 12]</p>
<p><em>SCP-2651-C's head forms a shape that appears to depict Neoproterozoic Era Earth. Smaller spheres detach from it and form various shapes and geometric structures, orbiting around the head.</em></p>

<p><strong>SCP-2651-B (all):</strong> (Unknown clicking vocalizations)</p>
<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> The armadas, the constructors, the blood-bringers(?) blinking into orbit? The lights of the vessels are flashing above the dark planet as they look down upon the new locale of our culture and all its future iterations.</p>
<p><em>No new symbols or vocalizations for a minute. The bleeding slows down. Haemorozin stops exiting SCP-2651-B7.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Gaze yourself upon the all encompassing sphere of ice and gray. The star of this new world flickers on its edge, and its cosmic heat spills into the void. The dull outline of the atmosphere glows to light the world and the void beyond.</p>
<p><em>SCP-2651-C stops forming new symbols on its head for a minute.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Gaze upon the planet's surface. Empty tundra(?), volcanic destruction, impossible lands, impossible beasts. Across an ice flat is a mass of machines, shredding through the terrain and constructing the first homes. Gaze at the thing shambling towards the machines, itself limbs flailing, itself maws flailing the viscera of the past failed machines. Yourselves spirits reach into the thing. Gaze inside and twist.</p>
<p><em>All entities spasm.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> The corpse of the thing melts into the ice and the machines continue. Ourselves spirits strengthen. Soon ourselves will rip the flaws of the world off and open the beauty underneath. The first cities will be built and our species will triumph. And should the invaders of the Third World find us once again ourselves will [Unknown: A long sentence]. All future beings will gaze upon us as ourselves gaze from the stars.</p>
<p><em>No new symbols or vocalizations for 38 seconds.</em></p>

<p><em>The spheres circling around SCP-2651-C's head reshape to form structures resembling SCP-2651-B instances and SCP-2651-C.</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Gaze yourselves and let itself drag ourselves spirits into godhood.</p>

<p><strong>SCP-2651-C:</strong> Itself is not Rakmou-leusan.</p>
<p><em>All SCP-2651-B instances and SCP-2651-C begin to convulse, its head rapidly oscillating and expelling chunks of ectoplasm.

The back half of SCP-2651-B7 abruptly breaks apart into small fragments and a large volume of haemorozin. Numerous small holes, matching the size of the bullets found in the cavern, begin opening along the remaining half as the entity collapses onto SCP-2651-A.</em></p>
<p><em>A loud whirring noise is produced by SCP-2651-A. Trails of ectoplasm extend out of it and connect with each entity. All SCP-2651-B instances and SCP-2651-C spontaneously relocate to their standard positions and appearances.</em></p>
