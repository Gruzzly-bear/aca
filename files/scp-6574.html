</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> All current practitioners of SCP-6574 are contained within Facility-07NZ on Taonga Tuku<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>, New Zealand. This facility maintains a cover story as the privately owned ‘Audrey Taumata Memorial Nature Reserve’.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-6574 is a ritual that channels the natural Geo-Thaumic energy of Taonga Tuku to create Class IV Psychospiritual Entities. The only known practitioners of this ritual are a flock of kea<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup>, who are believed to have learned it from the now defunct GOI-7114.</p>
<p>The kea flock are not themselves anomalous, but as a species they are naturally intelligent<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup> and are known to form strong social bonds. The usefulness and apparent simplicity of SCP-6574 has been sufficient for the kea to have passed on its practice through the generations of their flock since the disbanding of GOI-7114.</p>
<p>The purpose and function of SCP-6574 is not yet fully understood. However, the kea have been observed to conduct this ritual only after the death of a member of their flock. The ritual consists of members of the flock positioning themselves at certain points in relation to the corpse and making specific wing gestures and vocal intonations. Attempts to replicate these rituals with human participants have thus far been unsuccessful, with the exception of Experiment 23/11/1983.</p>
<p>SCP-6574-1 are the Class IV Psychospiritual Entities created by SCP-6574. They are invisible and inaudible under normal conditions, including both direct observation and most forms of recording equipment. Thaumaturgically sensitive recording systems have been somewhat more effective, showing indistinct dark masses around 1 to 3 meters in height. These masses are highly mobile and recordings have captured them emitting low pitched grunting sounds as well as loud booming vocalisations. These entities are highly territorial and respond violently to any perceived threats to the kea flock. They are also effective ambush predators, and have been observed to engage in hunting large mammals despite showing no capacity or desire to eat.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Origins and History:</strong> GOI-7114 consisted of the indigenous population of Taonga Tuku prior to European colonisation. This group appears to have been aware of the Geo-Thaumic energies present on the island, and to have developed a number of ritual practices to channel them. Of these ritual practices, only SCP-6574 remains. Little is known about this group as the Foundation had no direct interaction with them and they left no written records. All knowledge of this group comes from Foundation contacts within the Vatican Archives and the GOC.</p>
<p>Human habitation of Taonga Tuku first occurred some time in the late 1300s as a group of Māori from Aotearoa<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> settled there. It is unclear at what point they developed the capacity to utilise the island’s natural Geo-Thaumic energies, but these rituals were a central part of GOI-7114’s culture by the time of their first contact with Europeans.</p>
<p>Initial contact was friendly, with some trade established, and the Māori of Taonga Tuku remained largely isolated from the many conflicts and changes to traditional lifestyles that occurred on Aotearoa and many of the other islands. This was largely due to Taonga Tuku’s geography, with no natural harbours and mountainous terrain it was unsuitable for most forms of agriculture. This state of affairs continued until 1865, when GOI-1112<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> discovered the presence of easily accessible Geo-Thaumic energies on the island.</p>
<p>GOI-1112 utilised their contacts within the British authorities to have GOI-7114 declared rebels, and to have their land legally confiscated by the colonial government<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>. GOI-7114 attempted to resist the subsequent invasion but were unable to withstand the combined forces of the British military and GOI-1112. Those that survived the conflict were relocated to other parts of New Zealand, where they either assimilated into life in the larger cities and towns, or merged with other tribal groups. Much of the culture of GOI-7114 was lost at this point and oral histories amongst their descendants have yielded little useful information.</p>
<p>GOI-1112 attempted to utilise the Geo-Thaumic energies of Taonga Tuku to resurrect various historical and mythical figures<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup>. All such attempts were unsuccessful and the GOI-1112 presence on Taonga Tuku was eradicated by the GOC in 1954. After this, the island remained largely unpopulated until the late 1970s, at which point forested area in the southern lowlands was cleared to create pasture for grazing sheep. Throughout the time since GOI-7114 were forcibly disbanded, the kea practitioners of SCP-6574 remained isolated to the more mountainous northern portion of this island, and as such their anomalous capabilities remined undetected until 1982.<br/>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 15/06/1982</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Taonga Tuku, New Zealand</p>
<p><strong>Recovery Team:</strong> Recovery Team Alpha-3<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-8" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-8')">8</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Anomalous Activity:</strong> Multiple deceased sheep reported in the north of Taonga Tuku. Wounds indicated attack by a large avian entity, with talon and beak marks significantly larger than that of any known non-anomalous species. Deceased sheep were left for scavengers and the avian entity shows no sign of consuming or attempted to consume any of the corpses.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> The SCP-6574-1 entities were initially encountered during the capture of kea specimens as part of a sampling of native wildlife. Two members of the scientific team were injured in the initial attack and Agents with G47 visors<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-9" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-9')">9</a></sup> identified the SCP-6574-1 entities. Conventional weaponry and general purpose counter-religious invocations were ineffective, and several Agents were injured in the resulting conflict.</p>
<p>Agent Taumata was then able to identify that the SCP-6574-1 entities were acting in defence of the kea, and separated from the rest of Research Team Alpha-3 while firing at the kea flock. All SCP-6574-1 entities then pursued and ultimately killed her, allowing the remaining members of Research Team Alpha-3 time to retreat with the injured.</p>
<p>Later tracking of thaumaturgic energies led to the discovery of the flock of SCP-6574 practitioners, and their subsequent containment.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:125%;"><strong>Experiment Log: 23/11/1983</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This was part of a series of tests conducted in an attempt to identify and replicate the effects of SCP-6574. Lead Researcher Mateo Taumata operated a drone designed to imitate a kea that had been assimilated into the flock over the several weeks prior. Junior Researcher Matilda Danford was also present to assist. Both were in the Site Observation Room where they had access to thaumaturgically sensitive camera feeds from around Facility-07NZ.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Uh, 2:45pm and Dr Taumata is about to attempt to participate in the SCP-6574 ritual.</p>
<p>That’s the recording started now, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Okay, no problems so far. I’m just getting the drone into position, could you describe the situation for the record?</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Sure. So, earlier today when I was monitoring the kea’s enclosure I noticed Dotty-</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Subject-237.</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Uh, sorry, yes, Subject-237 was lying on the ground and didn’t appear to be moving. I approached and confirmed that she was deceased, and at that point I alerted Dr Taumata so that he could use the drone to participate in the SCP-6574 ritual.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> OK, great work Matilda. Now keep an eye on the display and let me know if anything shows up.</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Will do.</p>
<p>Oh, it looks like Subject-237’s parents are there, I recognise the grey colouration on her dad’s wing. It’s such a shame, y’know? Dotty looked fine at feeding time yesterday, and she was only three. I wonder what happened to her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> <em>sighs</em></p>
<p>You need to stop sympathising with your subjects if you ever want to get anywhere with the Foundation, Matilda. You’re a smart young woman and I know you have the potential to go far, but you have to get it into your head that these aren’t pets. Without an impartial perspective you will only put yourself and others at risk.</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Yes Doctor, you’re right, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><em>They sit in silence as Dr Taumata directs the drone to wait in position near Subject-237 while the other kea gather. When a majority of the flock is assembled, four move into position around the corpse of Subject-237, including the drone, and the SCP-6574 ritual begins.</em></p>
<p><em>Taumata directs the drone to make the appropriate vocalisations<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-10" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-10')">10</a></sup> and gestures at each point in the ritual.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Dr Taumata, I’m seeing something on the monitors, multiple shapes forming around 237.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Two to the north-east and one just south of the corpse?</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Yes Doctor, you can see them?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-11" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-11')">11</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Yes, I believe the ritual’s working…</p>
<p>Oh wow, I can see them clearly now.</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> What’s happening? It still just looks like blurs on all the monitors.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> It’s strange, they look partially transparent, maybe not fully corporeal, but the details are distinct. It’s like Dr Mathieson theorised, they’re <em>Phorusrhacids</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Sorry, what?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Terrorbirds. Extinct avian predators that filled the same ecological niche as lions or wolves. These are big ones though, there’s one there that’s got to be nearly three meters, and that beak!</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Oh, that explains the wounds on the sheep! The field reports said the wounds looked like a giant bird had ripped apart the sheep and… and the human victim. Sorry, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> It’s fine.</p>
<p>At first observation the entities don’t appear to be any more intelligent than the animals they resemble, which is good. Hopefully that means current containment methods will continue to be sufficient and we can-</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Matilda, please aim one of the C53s<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup> at the interior of the Observation Room, and then I want you to leave here as quickly as possible. There is an entity in the room with us.</p>
<p><strong>Rs. Danford:</strong> Is it one of the terrorbirds?</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> No. No, she looks human. An old Māori woman, with facial tattoos, wearing traditional dress and she… she’s talking to me.</p>
<p>I… I don’t know who you are. We’re scientists, we’re here only to study and to observe, we don’t mean you any harm.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup></p>
<p><em>At this point Matilda activated a C53 recording device, and then left the Observation Room. The C53 recording showed a blurred image, roughly humanoid in size and shape, standing in a previously unoccupied area of the Observation Room, adjacent to Dr Taumata. This entity is henceforth referred to as SCP-6574-B1</em></p>
<p><strong>SCP-6574-B1:</strong> But you are not just a scientist, my child, you are a person and you are in mourning.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> The kea are the ones mourning, I’m just observing. Who are you, where did you come from? Are you part of the Māori group who created this ritual?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6574-B1:</strong> No, I am not of those who wrought this magic, but I know them. In death, all are one. I am your family and your ancestors, my child, just as those mighty hunters are ancestors of the kea. The ritual was created to allow us to meet, to break the boundaries of life and death so that those who came before may give their descendants the help they need.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Ancestors, plural. So you’re not an individual, just some amalgamation of residual psychic energies, speaking in riddles to sound wise. How can I know that what you say is even true?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6574-B1:</strong> Because you feel its truth Mateo, because you need what this ritual provides.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> I don’t need anything to do with SCP-6574, I mourn my wife enough. This ritual brings no peace, it’s the reason she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6574-B1:</strong> The kea did not mean to hurt anyone, they summoned their ancestors to remember their dead and to help them hunt in times of need. When you and your colleagues came into their territory, the kea were afraid and called upon their ancestors for help. They did not know that you meant no harm, it was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Taumata:</strong> Small consolation. She’s gone now, dead and gone forever and all the ghosts and illusions in the world can’t change that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-6574-B1:</strong> The dead can never return to the world of the living, that much is true. But the kea carried on the ritual because it meant something to them, because they wished to remember those who had been lost. Because of that, you can remember me and my people Mateo, all those who remain only as memory. And that which is remembered is never truly lost.</p>
<p><em>At this point in the recording, the blurred image of SCP-6574-B1 altered in size and shape, becoming slightly larger, before approaching Dr Taumata and partially enveloping him. Dr Taumata has described that from his perspective the entity’s shape altered to resemble deceased Foundation Agent Audrey Taumata. At the point in which the entity partially enveloped him, he described the sensation of a warm embrace. After this, all thaumaturgic entities dissipated.</em></p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Closing Statement:</strong> Following the conclusion of this test, further research into GOI-7114 via the use of SCP-6574 is ongoing, under the direction of Dr Taumata. Additionally, Dr Taumata has requested and received authorisation to publicly release any non-anomalous findings on GOI-7114’s history and cultural practices.</p>
