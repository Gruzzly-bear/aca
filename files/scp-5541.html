<strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5541 is considered uncontainable at this time. There are no current theories or models that can be used as sufficient evidence to support acceptable proposals for novel containment measures of SCP-5541. It is unknown whether or not SCP-5541 needs to be contained at all, however, extensive analysis of data obtained from future outcomes suggests that prevention and/or the containment of affected timelines is integral to the continued existence of the Foundation and the current definition of consensus reality for the remainder of this iteration of the universe.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5541 is the designation for a temporally-certain outcome expressed throughout all future timelines that will be observed by the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department, beginning at the end of the current millennium, always between the years of 2995 and 3003 AD. This phenomenon is first observed at some arbitrary point after the events of <a href="/scp-4888">Operation HIGHLANDER</a>,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> which has been or will be the result of RCT-Δt's actions taken upon discovery of SCP-5541. Therefore, it is believed that the anomaly manifested via a closed-loop "bootstrap" temporal paradox.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> View the below materials for more information on temporal field theory and its relevance to SCP-5541.</p>

<p>RCT-Δt experimentation attempting to prevent the conception of the paradox does not appear to be effective. So far, over 150 attempts of varying methodology have been initiated by RCT-Δt traveling back to prevent RCT-Δt from traveling back and providing this document to a trusted member of Overwatch. If this document still exists in the repository before the date of its creation, then all tests have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>It is postulated that SCP-5541 cannot be prevented nor delayed without use of extreme measures such as anomalous tools or retrocausal weapons, which would be used to terminate or otherwise displace one or more parties involved in the creation of the paradox. However, it is impossible to confirm whether intervention of this type would have any effect on the outcome without doing so, let alone result in the desired outcome versus any number of potential negative impacts, such as an ontological breakdown of reality or unwanted alteration of future timelines.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>SCP-5541 is described as a global paradigm shift, affecting all timelines tangent to and including our own, starting at a single 4th-dimensional point that encompasses all frames of reality that occur during the causal loop—regardless of other initial conditions and outcomes leading up until the point of Emergence.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-5" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')">5</a></sup> This makes SCP-5541 the only known or hypothesized outcome to do so other than the heat death of this iteration of the universe. SCP-5541's nature and effect on sentient life is not entirely the same in all affected timelines, however, analysis indicates that at least some axioms can be considered certain at this time:</p>
<div class="notation smallmodal mod" style="background-color:inherit; border:none;">
<ul>
<li>All timelines observed by members of the Temporal Anomalies Department that fit the criteria will ultimately succumb to SCP-5541 around the end of the third millennium</li>
<li>Whether or not SCP-5541's emergence is a consequence of Foundation personnel observing these futures, the result of the causal loop itself, a multidimensional homogeneous wave function collapse synchronization,<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup> or any combination of these remains unknown and is unlikely to be determined</li>
<li>SCP-5541 will always involve the complete destruction of Foundation infrastructure, leading to the release of thousands of various anomalies, followed by the persecution of Foundation staff. To note, many previously-considered dangerous Keter/Apollyon-level entities, objects, concepts, locations, and phenomena do not activate or become docile once containment is broken while SCP-5541 is in effect</li>
<li>A <a href="/broken-masquerade-hub">Broken Masquerade</a> event will occur. Public opinion of Foundation efforts and employees will become overtly negative</li>
<li>A gestalt Group of Interest will form from several extant groups, all of which are confirmed dissidents of Foundation operations, named "The Allied Occult Initiative", designated SCP-5541-1/GOI-Ω, which will assume control over the entire planet</li>
<li>Mass thought and awareness of the public will shift, leading to a total unification of ideology and a restructuring of consensus reality, as it is defined by SCP-5541-1. Most irrational or undeserved fears, hatreds, behaviors, prejudices, and ideologies will effectively cease</li>
<li>Foundation testing logs and staff rosters will become public knowledge, former staff will be systematically hunted down and imprisoned or terminated via a variety of means by the public, encouraged by SCP-5541-1</li>
<li>SCP-5541-1 will also trigger similar events for select groups of interest, should they exist. This includes but is not limited to The Fifth Church, The Church of Sarkism, The Church of the Broken God, and Marshall, Carter &amp; Dark, Ltd.</li>
<li>A period of nonviolence and spiritual/intellectual enlightenment will occur, lasting anywhere from 5-30 years</li>
<li>Phenomena on Earth will become increasingly anomalous, during which time public perception of said phenomena will remain the same—A quality deemed "Nonchalance" by members of the Temporal Intelligence Community</li>
<li>If SCP-5541 cannot be stopped, our timeline and all timelines that diverged from ours since the causal loop will experience an emergent QK-Class "Quantum Degeneracy" End-of-World Scenario, designated SCP-5541-Ω, and all life on the planet will cease to exist</li>

<p>Aftermath of critical failure at Site-19.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As briefly touched upon above, SCP-5541's exact emergence point is unclear. It is typically marked by the loss of Foundation sites, important members of the Administration, and/or many personnel, ultimately leading to larger-scale failures.</p>
<p>In majority of instances, the destruction of one or more vital Foundation sites can be cited as the primary cause of systemic collapse of all organization operations. In some cases (~30%), this event can be traced to a severe containment breach. In less cases (&lt;10%), the cause is associated with internal sabotage, either as premeditated attempts by insurgents or stochastic incidents from disillusioned personnel acting as lone assailants. Nearly 60% of all cases were due to administrative/infrastructural failures such as communications breakdowns or containment constraints. ~1% of cases involve the spontaneous detonation of one or more on-site nuclear warheads or similar "black swan" preventative measures.</p>
<p>Attempts to divert or otherwise prevent Foundation collapse in timelines impacted by SCP-5541 have proven unsuccessful in all cases. Individual events can be mitigated, but without the proper foresight associated with backwards travel, it is impossible to predict when the next may occur. It appears that in most of these timelines, the Foundation was at risk of catastrophic failure for some time leading up to the event itself. Agents of Tactical Operations Command have attempted to "prime" specific timelines by traveling to a point prior to the window in which SCP-5541 will emerge, however, events occur that are beyond the scope of reach, or personnel are hampered by one or more individuals acting against the interests of the agents and the Foundation as a whole, rendering these efforts futile.</p>
<p>Attempts to establish contact with future members of the Temporal Anomalies Department have been similarly unproductive. Personnel in observed timelines generally express confusion at the presence of RCT-Δt agents from the past, possibly suggesting future agents are still traveling forward to deal with threats, isolating themselves from past members to safeguard against annihilation via self-interaction, and/or are aware of some information regarding SCP-5541 that, for an unknown reason, prohibits them from informing current RCT-Δt members of their status and whereabouts. Investigations into the future actions of the Temporal Anomalies Department are being considered, however, logistical concerns and inherent trust-related risks are major obstacles to these operations.</p>
<p>It is also to note that in most affected timelines, by the end of the third millennium, containment efforts have increased in cost, size, and complexity such that tracking all facets related to sustaining uniform operations is nearly impossible. In addition, average employee morale is at an all-time low in almost every instance.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 5541-Gleipnir</strong><br/>

<strong>Location:</strong> Containment Area-179, Universe-Kappa-Erikesh<br/>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Breach of <a href="/scp-2317">SCP-2317</a><br/>
<strong>Preface:</strong> <em>Up until now, SCP-2317 had been defying all previous predictions regarding its activation. SCP-2317-G had broken nearly 700 years prior and, despite this, no movement was detected until this moment.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p style="text-align: center;">[BEGIN LOG]</p>
<p><strong>14:20</strong> - Area-179 containment klaxon blares.</p>
<p><strong>14:22</strong> - SCP-2317 is seen standing from its structure within Universe-Kappa-Erikesh. Thermal sensors indicate a sharp increase in temperature.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>14:30</strong> - Deployed Foundation forces arrive at Area-179, which is suffering from severe siesmic activity. Religious figures and thaumaturges are brought on-site to perform various rites and blessings. O5 Council is taken off-world. Evacuating personnel and bystanders are seen crying, some contacting loved ones or emergency services.</p>
<p><strong>14:35</strong> - SCP-2317 breaks through the door to Universe-Kappa-Erikesh, stretching the portal to immense size. Foundation forces prove ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>14:42</strong> - SCP-2317 ignores all parties and leaves the containment area, walking westward.</p>
<p><strong>15:35</strong> - SCP-2317 travels several thousand kilometers to the country shoreline, taking pains to avoid crushing horrified pedestrians.</p>
<p><strong>16:25</strong> - SCP-2317 arrives at a local beach and sits, watching the horizon until sunset, several hours later (19:43).</p>
<p><strong>16:50</strong> - Children are seen playing in the sand on and around SCP-2317's feet for some time.</p>
<p><strong>20:04</strong> - SCP-2317 falls asleep on the beach, smiling. Squirrels and stray dogs gather around the entity and sleep/nest aside its form. Birds are observed landing on the creature's nose as it breathes. SCP-2317 remains in this location for upwards of a week, behaving in a largely similar manner for most of this timeframe. Foundation containment efficiency plummets from the subsequent Broken Masquerade Event, leading to systemic collapse of all operations within 48 hours, catalyzed in part due to an extremely successful doxxing campaign launched by members of the popular online variety content board "4chan".</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[END LOG]</p>

<p>SCP-5541-Ω does not typically manifest in the same manner between observed timelines. Often, it results from a secondary triggering event. Unfortunately, it is difficult to garner much detail about the exact nature of the event given the risk involved in doing so.</p>

<p><em>In light of information gained from extensive observations of SCP-5541 and its related effects, as well as various statistical and historical data, the Temporal Anomalies Department has decided to submit for review a proposal for SCP-001. Submitted Document 001-Δt can be found below, which is currently under review by the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, and the Temporal Intelligence Community.</em><br/>
<span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-001 (Pending Assignment)</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Aisna-Boltzmann<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-12" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-12')">12</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-001 is to be limited in scope to the best ability of the Foundation, but must not be completely contained nor abandoned at any time. This is to continue until such actions become impossible or are no longer necessary. It is believed that SCP-001's effects possess a certain "acceptable" range so as to ensure Foundation operations remain manageable and secure facilities self-sustainable for an indeterminate amount of time. Adhering to this range while undergoing a complete restructuring of protocol to one prioritizing rehabilitation, low-profile relocation, and reintegration services is the most optimal means of preserving consensus reality and the lives of nearly every being in the entire universe, across all universes and timelines that are impacted by SCP-001 itself.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-001 is the designation for an anachronistic metaphysical quality that permeates all systems of complex structures that possess sentience, can be defined as "human"/"humanoid", or can otherwise receive, store, and transmit high-order information. SCP-001 is believed to manifest as the outcome of a probabilistic scenario initiated when any 3rd-dimensional frame within a 4th-dimensional octahedral reality is subject to wave function collapse.</p>
<p>When probabilistic scenarios collapse via observation, there is an unknown likelihood<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-13" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-13')">13</a></sup> that SCP-001 will occur. When this happens, SCP-001 will randomly manifest anomalous phenomena at any synchronous point on the 3D frame that is also experiencing wave function collapse. This effect does not appear to have a limited range outside of the field of view and the ability to observe at a distance, so long as the space is unobserved in one frame, and is observed in some way in the next. Additionally, the process or sensory function in which the observation occurs does not appear to matter, although vision remains the most effective means of doing so that humans possess.</p>
<p>The intensity, frequency, and density of SCP-001's effect increases over each quantum of time elapsed, by a rate determined through the previous density of the effect and other factors such as broad awareness of this aspect of reality. When human entities gain knowledge of the anomalous, increase their population density, and/or unify their thought processes, the rate at which anomalous phenomena generates via SCP-001 increases. This also influences the radius of the same effect impacting a spherical area surrounding the brains of all affected organisms.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-14" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-14')">14</a></sup> Therefore, it is possible for this system to reach a "cascade" point, wherein a positive feedback loop of anomalous activity leads to the collapse of quantum systems due to insufficient universal resources. It is the conclusion of the Temporal Anomalies Department that "anomalies" are as intrinsic to reality as reality itself, perhaps associated with some unknown form of higher-order mathematics and/or sciences not yet known to us.</p>
<p>The inverse of this appears to also be true; when there are less observers in a space, the area being observed becomes less real by a faint, imperceptible, but entirely measurable change in Humes. As such, SCP-001 appears to suggest that "baseline" reality is malleable and "anomalous" in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
It is speculated that Hume loss of unobserved space correlates with a limited amount of "processing power" within the universe. Use of this finite quantity appears to be offset by an endogenous self-adjusting limiting/boosting mechanism, which helps regulate the Hume field of the surrounding reality. This is further corroborated by reports within spaces in which the Hume field logarithmically approaches zero, where human minds have been seen to <a href="/scp-3545">individually generate their own localized reality</a>. It appears there is an inherent property of reality that is necessary to observe in order to exist within, and yet cannot exist while unobserved.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The observer effect within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, SCP-001, appears to be at least partially responsible for the generation of large portions of our current universe, utilizing or being generated by humanoid life-forms. Thus the phenomenon is responsible both for the generation of anomalous activity/baseline reality and cannot be contained fully, nor should it remain uncontained. Due to the relationship with the very objects the Foundation has spent centuries studying, and the Organization's <a href="/scp-4002">strained relationship</a> with various groups considered "different" than humanity, such as <a href="/scp-1000">The Children of the Night</a>, RCT-Δt urges the Council to immediately reclassify all phenomena as explained through the nature of consensus reality and begin rehabilitation/reintroduction programs for all sentient creatures in containment that are capable of doing so.</p>
<p>This may be the only recourse we have to avoid the fate of our future selves. We will lose the war—but we believe things can still change so that it never happens in the first place.</p>
