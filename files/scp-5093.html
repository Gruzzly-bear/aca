<p>SCP-5093</p>
</div></div><div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5093</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Safe</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> The building containing the entrance to SCP-5093 has been purchased by the Foundation and converted to Provisional Site-5093. The storefront has been fitted with a biometrically locked door and affixed with shutters. Access is limited to personnel assigned to the SCP-5093 research team.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE AS PER THE ETHICS COMMITTEE (06/14/2020):</strong> Following the events of Exploration Log 5093-1 through 3, no personnel are to access SCP-5093. The storefront has been sealed off completely.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5093 is an extradimensional spatial anomaly manifesting in "White Satin Dance", a studio located in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. The interior of SCP-5093 resembles an unfurnished room, not unlike the studio's dance floor. SCP-5093 contains windows with a blue tint, allowing for view of numerous buildings similar in appearance to White Satin Dance visible in the distance. These buildings are accompanied by apertures identical to SCP-5093. White Satin Dance's external surface would not be able to accommodate an attachment of SCP-5093's size.</p>
<p>SCP-5093 is only accessible by exiting the building from its rear entrance. SCP-5093's manifestation is not triggered through a discernible pattern, but testing has shown that the anomaly appears once in every 20 openings of the door. Attempts to access SCP-5093 from the outside of the building have failed.</p>
<p>For precaution, SCP-5093 has not yet been entered or observed beyond what is visible from its manifestation. Testing will commence on 06/12/2020.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE AS PER THE ETHICS COMMITTEE (06/14/2020):</strong></p>
<p>Following the events of Exploration Log 5093-1 through 3, all testing involving SCP-5093 has been suspended.</p>

<li>D-128</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> First incursion into SCP-5093. One D-Class personnel (D-128) was equipped with recording equipment, a two-way radio, and an emergency ration. D-128 was instructed to investigate SCP-5093 while maintaining communication with control.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>D-128 enters SCP-5093.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Check?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Check?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Check.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Can you stop?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> <em>(Laughs)</em> Sorry. Cass, you good?</p>
<p><em>D-128 reluctantly moves forward, examining SCP-5093.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Yep. What's, uh, what should I expect?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Don't know yet. Figure it out, champ. You got this.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Well, it… looks normal. (<em>Gestures</em>) Nothing's jumping out at me, my brain doesn't want to burst out of my skull, I think it's just a room. We done?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Nope. Feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Peachy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Check the windows.</p>
<p><em>D-128 approaches a window.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Windows. Blue tint, buildings everywhere. Kind of look like the studio.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> (<em>Turns to Trenton</em>) Then that's… yeah. All the buildings are identical?</p>
<p><em>D-128 walks to the opposite side of the room and observes a window.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> All the same.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Try opening a door.</p>
<p><em>D-128 approaches the door in the upper right corner, and attempts to open it.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Locked.</p>
<p><em>D-128 attempts to open the other three doors found inside SCP-5093, consecutively failing.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> I could pick them, maybe. Looks like a regular lever handle.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Pauses)</em> Uh, sure. Go for it.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> With what, dumbass? The plastic fork?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Alright, relax. (<em>Turns to Researcher Starse</em>) Ang, can you get her something?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Paper clip good?</p>
<p><em>D-128 examines the door handle.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Yeah, that's fine.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Starse leaves her position from the control set-up. Dr. Trenton and D-128 have a conversation. Extraneous dialogue has been removed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> (<em>Yells</em>) Eric, come back here! I can't reach the box.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Gestures to screen</em>) Stay put. (<em>Yells</em>) Coming!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Trenton averts his eyes from the control set-up and stands up. He briefly pokes his head around the corner, where Researcher Starse is positioned. At this moment, the video feed is lost and SCP-5093 de-manifests. The door leading to SCP-5093 shows the ordinary exterior of Provisional Site-5093. Dr. Trenton looks visibly confused. He touches the radio he's equipped with. D-128's voice is heard.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Doc?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Uh, hello?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Doc, the door just disappeared. Like, the one I came in through. It's not there anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Hello? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Great joke. Seriously, it's not there anymore. What the fuck do I do?</p>
<p><em>Researcher Starse enters the control room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Is Cass ready?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> I… I need a second to think here. Who am I communicating with?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> (<em>Yells</em>) It's Cass! D-128! You want to fill me in on what's happening over there?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> That's her. Wasn't she with you?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) I thought so too.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Cass, where are you? We're about to start testing, get back to control.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> (<em>Yells</em>) You already started! I'm literally in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> I… don't think you are. We haven't manifested the anomaly yet. Can you just come to the room you were in two minutes ago?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Look, look. You manifested the room. It took a couple tries, but you got it. I geared up, and you sent me in. Look at the computer. You can't see me?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Trenton stares at the door SCP-5093 manifests itself in. Researcher Starse takes a seat at the computer terminal. Trenton begins examining the various equipment strewn around the room.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Black.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Equipment's gone too, shit. I guess we did send you in there.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Maybe it's one of those… things.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> What things?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Like, you guys definitely have a word for them. Like an amnestic, but it's a thing. You see it, and you forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> An antimeme?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> First time working with one of those.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Probably not. Anyway, what happened after you were in?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Tried to open the doors. Couldn't. Ang said she'd get me a paper clip. Couldn't. You left to go help her.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) We both left.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Yeah, and now I can't get out.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Hang on, we're manifesting the room again.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Trenton sits at the computer terminal.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Wait. Video feed auto-archives. (<em>Pauses</em>) There, feed's up.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Trenton successfully pulls up a playback of the recording prior to its disruption.</em></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> You can see me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Shakes head</em>) Old footage. Ang, come here.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> God, this is weird. That's the room?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Look away, and don't look back until I tell you to.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Starse looks away from the terminal. Trenton begins counting with his fingers while still facing the screen. After 10 seconds, she appears visibly confused and looks at Dr. Trenton without prompting.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> What's the room look like?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> I… didn't look at it yet.</p>

<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 06/12/2020</p>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> Two hours have passed since Exploration Log 5093-1. D-128 remains trapped inside SCP-5093. All attempts to manifest SCP-5093 by opening and closing the door have failed. Dr. Trenton and Researcher Starse remain seated at the computer terminal.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Yeah, I get how it works. What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Two options. First, we give the boys back home a call, get a thaumaturgy team. Try to magic you out of there. Could do that.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Or?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Or, we… Ang?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> I have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Nothing. I'll send the files to Raju's team. Scrub the memetic properties off, and we'll be able to go from there. You're going to be fine, Cass. Just relax.</p>
<p><em>Researcher Starse points to the screen, which displays the archive's files.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Whoa, whoa, slow down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> There's like, 5 files in there.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) The fuck?</p>
<p><em>Trenton clicks on a file. A visual perspective of an unidentified D-Class examining SCP-5093 is shown.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Who the hell's that?</p>
<p><em>Trenton and Starse watch in silence. Trenton skips around the video.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Cass, we're about to close a video, so we're not going to remember it. Tell us the file showed a D-Class examining the room, okay?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Wait, I thought I was the first one in.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> So did we.</p>
<p><em>Trenton skips towards the end of the video. The feed cuts out around 25 minutes. He closes the file. Trenton begins counting with his fingers. After 10 seconds, both he and Starse display confusion. D-128 informs them of the contents of the file they just opened.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> 'D-114 test log'. 05/02/2020. 'D-126 Test Log'. Date 06/03/2020. Oh, God, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Don't open any more.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Those are from last month. Have we—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Apparently. Christ, we lost seven D-Class to this thing, and we didn't even realize it?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> That's reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> I'm calling site, this is just—</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> No. Don't. You don't think you didn't try that already? Listen, I don't know if I'm right about this, but this, (<em>Pauses</em>) it's all happened before. You get a D-Class, send them in, something happens, they get stuck, you call the site in an attempt to get them out, and then what? You're still here. What happened to the other Ds before me?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> You're saying Site is keeping us here on purpose? To do the same thing over and over again? That's ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Someone had to send you more test subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Every research team requests more D-Class.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> I know it sounds wrong, but.. you know who you work for. Would you really be that surprised? What if you call them up and they tell you to keep me here? What if something happens after a certain amount of time, and that's the real experiment? You know how these things work.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> She has a point. They didn't make it out, and we don't even remember sending them in. Something's going to happen to Cass very soon, and then we'll be back to square one.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> We forgot about the rest of them. What if this thing erases you completely?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> It makes no sense, though. Not the anomaly, but why we're here. What's the point of doing a test over and over again, if it's always going to end the same?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> You have security cameras on your end, doc?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) Yeah. One in the control room.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Where's the security feed?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> We're able to bring it up from the terminal. (<em>Pauses</em>) Archive goes back only a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> What? It should go back to last month.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Big Brother's watching. I guess you're D-Class too, doc. (<em>Laughs</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> What the hell do we do? What are we supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> This isn't right. Not at all. Eric, I'm not going to have her die on us so we could do it again tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> (<em>Yells</em>) Again, what are we supposed to do? If we're here, it's for a reason!</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) You have access to the security feed, and my exploration footage. The feed has audio, yeah?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Trenton checks the feed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> Make a transcript. Write everything down up to now, and when whatever happens to me happens, and you forget everything, you could read it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) That might actually work, Cass. There's three of us, any memory discrepancies between us can easily be sorted out if we're careful enough. Eric?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Alright… I'll do it. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little concerned.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXPLORATION LOG 5093-3</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DATE:</strong> 06/13/2020</p>
<p><strong>NOTES:</strong> D-128 has remained trapped inside SCP-5093 for over 8 hours. Dr. Trenton and Researcher Starse prepare an object file as well as a transcript of D-128's exploration using footage from the archive and the security feed. Notably, an early draft of the file, detailing containment procedures, a description, and a photo of SCP-5093 that holds no apparent antimemetic effect, was found on the computer terminal — dated 05/01/2020. Neither personnel have recollection of writing this document.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>&lt;BEGIN LOG&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> Cass? We're done with the file, at least up until we decided to make one.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> I don't know. Should we call and see what happens?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Hold off. Whatever's going to happen to Cass is going to erase her from our memory, at least, I think. What if calling the Site triggers that?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> If the security feed is still running, and it is, they don't know the experiment isn't over yet. Means they aren't watching live.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> I'd love to know who 'they' are.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> For all we know, us grinding D-class like this could be supplying energy to the whole planet. Shit, we could be the only thing between an eldritch abomination and the safety of the humanity. Literally anything can be happening here, and it's all a few security clearances above us.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Trenton:</strong> And if it's for the greater good? What if we shouldn't stop? Maybe it's better we don't remember what we do, but we wouldn't be here without a purpose. I'll stand by that.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> I guess we're about to find out. God, what is it, four in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> I'm tired, not going to lie. Look, I'm going to sleep, and you're going to finish the transcript, like, from the last five minutes. I'll see you in the morning, or maybe I won't. Who knows.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> You're oddly calm about this, Cass.</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> I wasn't going to be remembered either way. You won't either. You live in secret, not knowing who or what you're fighting for half the time. You can be killed at a moments notice, and no one might ever know why. Hell, you can't even get an on-site therapist. Might be an information breach. Just take the damn amnestics, and keep doing your job. Both of you, senior researchers, and you're being used as guinea pigs without your consent. I'll be erased from memory, and one day, you will too. Just different ways to go about it.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> (<em>Pauses</em>) Anything else you'd like to add?</p>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> (<em>Yawns</em>) Nope. Night.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Goodnight, Cass.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;END LOG&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Researcher's Note:</strong> D-128 remained silent for the next half hour as Researcher Starse transcribed the above portion. Posthumous security footage analysis shows D-128 remained silent until around 08:00, when they spoke again.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>D-128:</strong> (<em>Laughs</em>) They see me. From the outside. I'll be there too.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Attempts to respond to D-128 resulted in failure. SCP-5093's antimemetic properties came into effect shortly after.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 5093.2:</strong> Update (06/14/2020)</p>
<p>Dr. Trenton and Researcher Starse turned in the above file on 06/14/2020. In line with the Ethics Committee's investigation regarding explorations of SCP-5093, containment procedures have been updated. Footage of previous SCP-5093 investigations found on the archive is being curated and researched. A description update is pending until a more complete understanding of SCP-5093's mechanics can be discerned.</p>
<p>Foundation personnel archives hold no record of any D-Class personnel involved in SCP-5093 experimentation.</p>
