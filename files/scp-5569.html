<h4 id="toc1"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Containment Procedures</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>Due to the nature of the anomaly, direct containment of SCP-5569 is currently unfeasible.</p>
<p>In cooperation with the municipal government of the Sharqia Governorate of Egypt, the exhumation of recently deceased human remains is strictly forbidden. All death records and autopsies are to have any mention of SCP-5569-2 removed. The occupation of coroner and undertaker is to be a Foundation-regulated government-appointed position; all individuals employed will receive a monthly amnestic treatment to remove knowledge of SCP-5569-2. Any civilian discoveries of SCP-5569-2 will be discredited, have evidence destroyed, and/or witnesses amnestisized at the discretion of the responding concealment team.</p>
<p>A Foundation security detail is to remain posted at the Bubastis excavation site. Access to SCP-5569-1 is strictly forbidden to civilians, as well as Foundation personnel. The Foundation-led Tell Basta Project is authorized to operate within Bubastis under the stipulation that SCP-5569-1 remains undisturbed.</p>
<p>In the situation that SCP-5569-1a is breached, Mobile Strike Force Gamma-77 ("Solomon's Bane") is to be dispatched to facilitate re-containment.</p>
<p><strong>Update|2016/01/22:</strong> In order to ensure that SCP-5569-1a remains sealed the construction of an S-Class Thaumic Neutralization Chamber surrounding SCP-5569-1 has been approved. The chamber's estimated time of completion is 2020/10/31.</p>
</div>
<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc2"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-5569-1 is an underground temple complex located in Bubastis, Egypt; the inner chambers of which are sealed by a thaumaturgic array. The phenomenon designated SCP-5569-2 is centered around the SCP-5569-1 complex.</p>
<p>SCP-5569-2 is a phenomenon affecting human corpses within a 3000 km<sup>2</sup> area of the Sharqia Governorate of Egypt. SCP-5569-2 causes deceased humans to have their tongues demanifested from their bodies within 24 hours postmortem. The demanifested tongues will re-manifest within SCP-5569-1's main chamber. These tongues show no signs of decomposition despite existing in conditions otherwise incapable of such preservation. The tongue's preservation appears to last indefinitely unless the tongue is removed from SCP-5569-1, at which time rapid decomposition occurs. There are estimated to be over 2.5 million human tongues within SCP-5569-1.</p>
<p>Systematic exhumation and examination of human remains revealed that SCP-5569-2 has affected 100% of deceased humans within its area of effect. This has occurred since approximately 1964; as human remains from prior to 1964 have been unaffected by SCP-5569-2.</p>
</div>
<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc3"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>On 1965/02/11, the Foundation was contacted by a representative of the United Arab Republic regarding the SCP-5569-2 phenomenon. Through a joint effort with the local government, SCP-5569-2's area of effect was established along with its containment procedures.</p>
<p>SCP-5569-1 was discovered by the Tell Basta Project on 2015/03/14, during the routine excavation of Bubastis. Dr. William Cooper was the first person to enter SCP-5569-1, uncovering the main chamber and its large quantity of human tongues shortly thereafter. Dr. Cooper reported his findings to the Tell Basta Project's Foundation liaison, at which time the connection to SCP-5569-2 was made. The Foundation dispatched Archeological Task Force Mu-4 ("Tomb Robbers") as a response to the initial discovery. Due to the presence of several thaumaturgic runes, Dr. Giovanni Caprini<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> was assigned to facilitate any necessary thaumaturgic response.</p>
</div>
<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc4"><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCP-5569-1 Report</span></strong></span></h4>
<p>SCP-5569-1 consists of three concentric areas, the outermost of which(designated SCP-5569-1c) was discovered in 1964 during Bubastis's initial excavation. The artifacts found within SCP-5569-1c included artistic pieces, mundane documents, several human remains, and over 300,000 mummified felines. Of the objects discovered by civilians in 1964, none showed any signs of anomalous properties. Dr. Caprini theorizes that the excavation of the outer chamber is what triggered the SCP-5569-2 phenomenon.</p>
<p>Unlike the outer area, SCP-5569-1b drastically differs from typical Egyptian temples with very little artistic or religious paraphernalia. One hieroglyphic mural is present in the main chamber depicting a battle or war fought and won against an army of feline entities.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> Of the 14 chambers discovered within SCP-5569-1b, only the main chamber and innermost wall had shown signs of anomalous properties. The main chamber forming the center for the SCP-5569-2 ritual and the inner walls completing a second thaumaturgic seal surrounding the innermost chamber (designated SCP-5569-1a). Along with the powerful thaumic seal, there was a warning above the door within the main chamber leading to SCP-5569-1a, written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, demotic, and Greek. The following is an English translation of the warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here sleeps the brood mother.</p>
<p>When the Third Seal breaks, bare us your tongues.</p>
<p>Repair the Third Seal.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-3" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Should the Second Seal break, Our Speech/Tongue will fend off the fiend.</p>
<p>Uphold the Second Seal.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Do not fall prey to its lies–</p>
<p><strong>The remaining inscriptions were indecipherable due to erosion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Radar, thermal, and sonographic examination of SCP-5569-1a revealed it to consist of one corridor leading to a large chamber. The only object within this chamber was a small geological structure, correctly theorized to be a statue.</p>
<p>Exploration of SCP-5569-1a was approved and scheduled for 2015/05/23.</p>
</div>
<div class="addenda-header">
<h4 id="toc5"><span>Incident Report | Operation Inner-Circle</span></h4>
<p>On 2015/05/23, an attempt to explore SCP-5569-1a was made, designated Operation Inner-Circle. The procedure for exploration was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>One D-Class personnel will be fitted with a hazmat suit, lighting apparatus, and a shoulder-mounted audio/video recording device.</li>
<li>A five member detachment of MSF Gamma-77 will be prepared on standby in the main chamber of SCP-5569-1.</li>
<li>Four technicians will open the door to SCP-5569-1a allowing the D-Class to enter.</li>
<li>The technicians will seal the door behind the D-Class at which time it will remain sealed for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>The D-Class will explore the SCP-5569-1a chamber and any occupants thereof.</li>
<li>After 20 minutes the chamber will be opened, and the D-Class removed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Operation Inner-Circle was conducted at 13:30, the following is a transcription of the event:</p>

<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> D-7740k, Captain Reinner, mic check.</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Aye.</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Read you loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Captain, I'd like your channel muted for the duration of the experiment, unless otherwise needed.</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Understood, going dark.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> D-7740k, I would like you to activate the device on your shoulder. There will be a rectangular button on the right side– please press it.</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> You got it. Here, how's that?</p>
<p><em>[The video feed activates revealing five MSF agents and the four technicians standing before a large stone door with intricate patterns carved upon it. The floor is covered in human tongues, coming knee-high on the MSF agents.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Excellent. Now as you know, once inside you will have 20 minutes to enter the inner chamber, explore, and exit the chamber. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Absolutely, can we– can we just do this though? This room really gives me the willies.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k begins wading forward through the viscous layers of human tongues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> This is not what I was ima–</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k slips and falls, the tongues envelop him and the camera in a dark shade of pink, the sound of wet meat moving can be heard. He grunts as Captain Reinner pulls him from the floor.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner</strong> Watch out there, champ.</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Can we <em>please</em> get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> You may proceed.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k finally makes it to the stone door, the four technicians are prepared to open it. As they struggle through the layer of tongues and open the door a dark corridor comes into view; D-7740k enters.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr-7740k:</strong> Shit, it's dark in here.</p>
<p><em>[As the lighting apparatus activates D-7740k turns around to see the door seal behind him.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Remember, 20 minutes. Please proceed down the corridor.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k walks down the corridor, focusing on the walls, intricate thaumaturgic lattices line them.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> These don't really look like the movies, do they?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> The movies?</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Oh, you know, like "The Mummy" or "Scorpion King", with the holographic walls. These don't look like that.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Oh. Yeah, that's because those are not "hieroglyphics".</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k</strong> Well yeah, I fig– Do you hear that?</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k stops a meter from the end of the corridor. No sounds can be heard aside from D-7740k's breathing.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> I did not pick anything up, what did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> It sounded like talking, or like, whispering maybe– Oh wait, there it was again!</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> It could be feedback from coms on your end, please proceed cautiously.</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Okay, here I go.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k enters the chamber, it is circular in shape, the walls are decorated with a large mural across the entire room. A small statue sits in the center of the chamber.]</em></p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Oh wow, this place is, pretty cool. There's a lot of drawings on the walls here– and a cool cat statue to boot. I don't know, this all looks pretty no– What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> I didn't say anything. Are you feeling okay, D-7740k?</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> I'm uh, yeah, I'm fine. Must just be the feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Very well, I'd like you to walk along the walls and get footage of some of the murals.</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Sure thing, these ones are a lot cooler than the ones in the hallway.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k proceeds to walk along the wall. The murals depict many struggles between seven warriors and various feline and humanoid-feline entities. It also shows these warriors constructing SCP-5569-1. Feline entities, tongues, and circles are prevalent throughout the art.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> D-7740k, you have seven minutes remaining. I'd like you to record the statue in the center of the chamber and then exit.</p>
<p><em>[The camera angle begins shifting back and forth as D-7740k looks around the room.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> D-7740k, do yo–</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> What? I can't– Where is that coming from? It's so freakin’ loud!</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> D-7740k, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Yeah, I can hear you now– I don't know for a second it. Sounded like someone was screaming. I couldn't understand wha–</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> You have five minutes. Please proceed to the statue, and then exit the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>D-7740k:</strong> Um, yeah, okay.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k begins walking towards the statue.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Captain Reinner, do you copy?</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Copy, Control.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Please ready the medical team for D-7740k, and activate your vid feed.</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Roger that. Is everything okay in there?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Just a precaution, please standby.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k circles around before crouching eye level with the feline statue.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> That's enough, D-7740k. Please exit the chamber; four minutes remain.</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k remains silent and stares into the statues face.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Please exit the cham–</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k abruptly stands and turns around, running through the exit and down the corridor. He stops one meter from the stone door leading to SCP-5569-1b.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> D-7740k, the door is about to open, please exit slowly and place your hands on the wall next to the door. A medical team will be taking you in for evaluation. Do you understand?</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k remains silent]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Captain be advised, I believe D-7740k has been compromised. You may need to assist the medical staff.</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Understood.</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Open the door.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> You heard the lady, let's get moving. Spread out.</p>
<p><em>[Reinner is standing within SCP-5569-1b, two meters from the stone door that is flanked by the four technicians. His team is standing on each side of Captain Reinner.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Once the D-Class gets through I want him on that wall and restrained. We're not taking any chances. Open it.</p>
<p><em>[The four technicians open the stone door, D-7740k can be seen standing in the corridor. After a moment he begins to run through the door stopping as he steps into the mass of tongues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Get up against the wall, D-7740k. I'm only asking nicely once.</p>
<p><em>[Reinner steps forward and stops as D-7740k drops to his knees. D-7740k proceeds to scoop tongues from the mass and press them against his hazmat suit visor. He grunts in frustration.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> He's in the way of the door. Cooper, Riley restrain him and get him out of there.</p>
<p><strong>Cooper:</strong> Got it.</p>
<p><em>[Agents Cooper and Riley slowly approach with restraints and batons in hand. D-7740k smashes his hands through his plastic visor and tears it apart, heavily damaging his finger in the process. He eventually tears the head unit from the hazmat suit, and frantically begins consuming the tongues.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Christ, get the fuck in there.</p>
<p><em>[Agent Cooper grabs D-7740k's shoulder as he continues to consume whole tongues. Cooper jerks him backward and D-7740k lunges on top of him. Agent Riley manages to pull D-7740k off by putting him in a chokehold.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Riley:</strong> Scrappy fella, ain'tcha.</p>
<p><strong>Cooper:</strong> What the fuck man– you see his eyes?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Captain, please get in close enough to see his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><em>[Captain Reinner focuses the camera on D-7740k's face, his pupils are extremely dilated and moving erratically in all directions.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Cooper:</strong> How can he ev–</p>
<p><em>[Agent Riley screams as D-7740k reaches back and shoves his hands under the agent's ribcage. Grabbing firmly D-7740k pulls Agent Riley's bottom ribs through the skin, blood pools out of the wounds. Agent Riley collapses.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Reinner lunges forward and grabs D-7740k who pushes the captain several feet back before screaming incoherently in an unknown language.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Cooper:</strong> Fuck this!</p>
<p><em>[Agent Cooper hits D-7740k in the face with his thaumically enhanced baton, leaving a burn mark across his face. D-7740k jumps on top of Cooper. He proceeds to unhinge his jaw and place it around Agent Cooper's mouth and clamps down. As D-7740k crawls off the agent a large mass can be seen forcing its way down Cooper's bulging throat. Agent Tobin rushes towards D-7740k as Agent Willow checks on Agent Riley's condition.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Control, is lethal force authorized?</p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Negative, Captain Reinner, I want him alive.</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Copy. Willow– get him out of here! Tobin stay the fuck back a sec–</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k rushes forward with preternatural speed, gripping Agent Tobin by the bottom jaw. He proceeds to rip it downwards; with his teeth D -7740k removes Agent Tobin's tongue and swallows it.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Willow:</strong> Riley's gone, Captain. What's the plan?</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k drops to the ground and begins consuming tongues. Agent Cooper gasps for air as he gets onto his knees and starts gagging. A much larger mass can be seen bulging its way up Agent Cooper's throat. It can be seen shifting position before stopping midway up, stretching his skintight. Cooper reaches up to his throat as something tears through the skin. A feline appendage rips through followed by another. A medium-sized domestic cat rips free of Cooper's throat, nearly severing his head.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> I'm sorry Control, but that's just about enough of that. You can study his corpse.</p>
<p><em>[Captain Reinner removes his sidearm and takes aim at D-7740k. Both D-7740k and the cat are both distracted by consuming the tongues. Reinner shoots the cat four times before it slumps to the ground. D-7740k begins shrieking incoherently as he stands. Agents Reinner and Willow proceed to fire 14 thaumic rounds into D-7740k.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Captain Reinner, your orders were explicit–</p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> Fuck the orders– this thing was killing us. Get that goddamn door closed.</p>
<p><em>[The technicians can be seen quickly struggling through the tongues to get to the door. D-7740k begins shaking violently as his body begins to swell.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Reinner:</strong> I think we go–</p>
<p><em>[D-7740k's body erupts, blood and viscera spraying the chamber and its remaining occupants. The stone door slams shut, tossing the technicians to the side.]</em></p>
