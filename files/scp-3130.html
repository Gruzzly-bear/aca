            <h1>SCP-3130</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-3130</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Floor 31 of Site-88 is currently undergoing reconstruction. All personnel involved in Incident 3130-F are to be presumed missing until located.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3130 is a 21 year old female, previously known as ██████ ████████. SCP-3130 appears to be aware of its immediate surroundings, but it has been unable to respond to questioning from personnel since initial recovery nor able to understand where it is located beyond its immediate surroundings. Although SCP-3130 can be interacted with, it is unable to connect any interactions with it to personnel, instead attributing it to various other stimuli.</p>
<p>When SCP-3130 wishes to accomplish a task or wholeheartedly believes itself to accomplish a task, two figures (SCP-3130-1) will manifest within a 30-meter radius around it. They will then carry out SCP-3130's task or belief, manipulating reality to do so. After accomplishing this, SCP-3130-1 will stand near SCP-3130 for 24 hours before disappearing. SCP-3130 does not interact with these figures except in rare circumstances. Attempts to interact with SCP-3130-1 have failed; they do not interact with or acknowledge Foundation staff. Objects and personnel outside of SCP-3130's local reality manifestations at the time they occur will not be retroactively affected once they enter.</p>
<p>SCP-3130 was recovered from Madison, Florida on April 12th, 2015 by LMTF 352-Lamedh ("Stump Knockers"). The house, found to be its previous living space, had been restructured into a haphazard botanical garden unable to be used by anyone except itself. A statue was located in the middle of the garden. Family records indicate that SCP-3130's stepfather, ███ █████████, was reported missing the same day; it is likely that this statue used to be Mr. █████████. SCP-3130 was moved into Foundation custody with little trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 3130-F:</strong> On October 20, 2016, alarms went off at Site-88. Personnel arriving discovered that a 50m radius located in Floor 31 had vanished with no signs of debris or destruction. All personnel reporting to work in Floor 31 were found to be missing, and have been unable to be located. Personnel in unaffected areas of Floor 31 heard a loud exclamation from a voice matching SCP-3130 wishing to stop before alarms were triggered and SCP-3130, along with most of Floor 31, had disappeared. As of May 20, 2017, SCP-3130, most of Floor 31, and the personnel located in said missing portion have still not been located. SCP-3130 has been reclassified to Neutralized.</p>
