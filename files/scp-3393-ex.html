<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-3393-EX is Dr. Hailey Rivera, Level 3 researcher in the Antimemetics Department. Dr. Rivera is unable to retain knowledge regarding Dr. Verity or perceive him when directly confronted. No such anomalous properties were exhibited by Dr. Rivera prior to 04/12/16. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The origin of these anomalous properties is still under investigation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The following is security footage from Dr. Rivera's office demonstrating the effects of Rivera's anomalous properties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dr. Verity approaches Dr. Rivera's office. He stands in front of the door with his hand raised to knock. Dr. Verity then looks up and down the hallway, and checks his phone. He turns back to the door. He knocks on the door twice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey? You in there?</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> I know you're in there. Rachel told me you didn't have any meetings today.</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> I can tell you're not exactly happy with me. I just want to talk to you about it.</p>
<p><em>There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Talking through a door probably isn't helpful… I'm coming in.</p>
<p><em>Verity opens the door and enters the office. Rivera is sitting at her computer, writing up a recent testing report.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey… we can't work through this if all you do is ignore me.</p>
<p><em>Rivera does not turn around.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Can't you at least turn around? Look at me. Like, this is just being a dick.</p>
<p><em>Rivera does not turn around. Verity grabs the back of Rivera's chair.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Just a little spin. It's not that hard.</p>
<p><em>Verity spins Rivera's chair to face him. Rivera stops typing and places her hands in her lap.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> See, that wasn't that hard. Right? Hailey?</p>
<p><em>Verity waves a hand in front of Rivera. There is no response.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey? Hailey!</p>
<p><em>Verity shakes Rivera.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Why won't you say anything!</p>
<p><em>Verity stops shaking Rivera. His breathing is erratic. Rivera turns back to her computer.</em></p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Hailey?</p>
<p><em>There is no response. Verity runs out of Rivera's office.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: blue">I see you left out that I suggested you to talk to her face to face instead of just texting "Hello?" every day.</span></p>
<p><strong>Addendum 3393-EX-2:</strong> The following is a transcript from an interview between Dr. Verity and Dr. Rachel Frie, a close friend of Dr. Rivera. The interview was conducted one day after Dr. Verity recognized that Dr. Rivera had been exhibiting anomalous properties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Oh, you even brought a recorder. I thought "interview" was a coy way of asking if I wanted to grab lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Sorry about that. Unfortunately this is official business.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> So, you're not asking me about Hailey?</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> I am. That's why it's official business.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> You're kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> She's not answering my texts, my calls and when I went to her office—</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I already told you, that's called the silent treatment, Julius.</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> But she stared right through me! Like I wasn't even there!</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> You've seen amnestized people before. There's that look in their eyes, like an emptiness.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> You can see why I'm worried.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I do, yeah. But I'm also pretty sure that it's just you.</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Exactly, which is why I need you to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I mean, even if she did get wiped—</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Please. I need to go back and see if I can see if anything sparked this, but I only know so much. I'm not in her head and… well I'm not anywhere to her.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> … fine. I'll talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>Verity:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: blue">Verity then left Frie to eat lunch by herself.</span></em></p>

<p><strong>Addendum SCP-3393-EX-3:</strong> Below is the transcript from the Q&amp;A section of Dr. Rivera's presentation on her new amnestic drugs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Umm… and yeah. That's the work we've done on Identity Erasure Amnestics. Do we have any questions?</p>
<p><em>A line forms in front of a microphone set up in the middle of the audience. Dr. Johanson is the first in line.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Johanson:</strong> You said that the drug works by breaking down and then repairing certain synapses. How do you ensure that you only target neural connections regarding people and not, say, general knowledge or habits.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Well, um, luckily most of the time, people are not directly tied to that type of knowledge. They may be associated, but there's degrees of separation so there's a lower likelihood we'll, uh, we'll touch those synapses.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Johanson:</strong> I see. Also congratulations on your presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Thank you!</p>
<p><em>Dr. Johanson returns to his seat. Dr. Verity approaches the microphone next.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> You mentioned earlier you had strong success with erasing memories of most forms of relationships, could you expand on which relationships you had issues with?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Which kind of relationships? I'm not exactly sure what you mean—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Like, say, twins.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Oh. Like twins.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Or other forms of intimate or familiar relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> Well, we did have issues with twins… they um, they have a few issues with um…<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Could you speak up?<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> They would sometimes over-flow into untargeted neural pathways, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Can you elaborate?</p>
<p><em><span style="color: blue">Dr. Rivera squeezes her hands into fists.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> People forgot what their own face looked like! But using amnestics to make twins forget each other is—</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Verity:</strong> Did the new amnestic experience similar failures in any circumstances?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dr. Rivera:</strong> No. Just the twins. Next question.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Verity returns to his seat. <span style="color: blue">Dr. Rivera turns away from the microphone, takes three deep breaths before continuing with the questions. Her voice remains strained and on edge.</span></em></p>
<p>&lt;<strong>Remaining transcript elided for brevity</strong>&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color: blue">What should go here is "As demonstrated above, Dr. Verity took out his bottled up feelings of jealousy through purposefully provocative questioning during a public event, instead of being open about his emotions". You can even use that word for word.</span></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Currently, it is believed that during her demonstration of her amnestics for the Ethics Committee, Dr. Rivera's drug malfunctioned, causing her to mentally suppress the existence of Dr. Verity. Investigation of how to possibly recover from such an erasure is underway. Additional information from Dr. Frie's interview with Dr. Rivera may lead to new breakthroughs.<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-7" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')">7</a></sup></p>

<p><em>I didn't want to tell you but… she wiped herself for a reason.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The following is a recording collected by standard Foundation surveillance equipment in the Site-77 cafeteria, prior to Dr. Rivera's Ethics Committee demonstration.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> It's been a minute since we've had lunch, hasn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> Does it count as lunch if you're recording the conversation?</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I mean… it can? I just, I'm doing this for a friend. We can grab lunch tomorrow without any hot mics.</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> It's fine. You don't have to force yourself to be nice to me. You can ask your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I'm not forcing it.</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> Well, in that case you don't have to hold yourself to it.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> … I'm not sure I understand. But, I think I'm just going to ask anyways. Do you… have you been receiving messages from Julius?</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> So he already talked to you?</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> So you're getting his texts.</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> I— of course I am.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I just wanted to make sure. I thought he was being stupid, but better safe than sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> He can't fathom a reason why someone would ghost him.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> But still, he's reaching out, and you're just… ignoring him.</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> I don't know. I just— I can't stand it. I can't fucking stand him anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I mean, he's just trying to understand what's going on with you.</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> He doesn't care about me! He uses me as some excuse to grand stand and feel good about himself! Did you hear him during my plenary talk?</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> I did but—</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> He knew I couldn't answer those questions well. He knew that there were edge cases I hadn't covered yet and he just shouted them out like no one important was listening! And you know what he said when I confronted him about it?</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> He did it to help you?</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> He's been stuck doing low-level testing. I know he wants his name in big letters on a new project. He hates that I'm ahead of him. You should hear him trying to arrange a date. Saying I work too much. That he can help me relax. He wants me to lean on him like a crutch. He's so blind to it that when I ignore him he thinks there's a goddamn anomaly. He's so persistent…</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Then why don't you tell him that?</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> … Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> Have you never had to break up a relationship?</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Of course I have!</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> Then you should know how hard it is to tell someone they're trying too hard! Or that they're trying for the wrong reasons! Or that you want someone who had been so nice to you for so long to get out of your life!</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> So you don't want people to be nice to you?</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> That's not what I'm saying and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> But you just said you wanted him to stop—</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> Just shut up! This isn't your ex we're talking about!</p>
<p><strong>Frie:</strong> Is he an ex if you never tell him you've broken up?</p>
<p><strong>Rivera:</strong> … I'm leaving.</p>
