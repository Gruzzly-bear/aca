            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-7938</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Neutralized</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Class:</strong> Mutually Dependent<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Given the 1981 World Chess Championship, the sporadic nature in which SCP-7938 manifested, and the 2016 expiration of SCP-7938-B, future SCP-7938 events have been deemed impossible. No containment procedures are required, and SCP-7938's primary containment class has been designated, "Neutralized".</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7938 was a supposed reality-bending temporal anomaly that occurred between July 18, 1978 - October 18, 1978. SCP-7938 consisted of SCP-7938-A, known as "Anatoly Karpov", and SCP-7938-B, known as "Viktor Korchnoi". The hypothesized manifestation of SCP-7938 is believed to have been contingent on the competition of both SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B in the 1978 World Chess Championship.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-7938 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on October 18, 1978, when numerous transcribed chess games and recorded television broadcasts were found to have been documented on the SCP-7938 file. The validity of the existence of SCP-7938 is unverifiable, as information regarding the anomaly only exists within the SCP file.</p>
<p>Upon being interviewed, SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B claimed to have no recollection of SCP-7938. Eyewitness information received suggested upon analysis that the relationship of SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B was at least partially altered following the supposed conclusion of SCP-7938 from what it was prior.</p>

<hr/></div>
<p>The 1978 World Chess Championship was an event where the first player to win six games would become the World Chess Champion. Per FIDE rules, a win would count towards 1 point for the victor, 0 points for the loser, and a draw would result in both players gaining 0.5 points.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h3 id="toc1"><span>Game #1, July 18 | 1978</span></h3>
<hr/></div>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Draw</p>
<p><strong>Termination:</strong> Unwilling bodily-movement</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> After 52 minutes, both players agreed to a draw and exited the room. Both players re-entered the room after 5-minutes and resumed the chess game for 254 moves until no further moves were theoretically possible. Staff that attempted to intervene were terminated via blunt force trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> 21,900 civilians have been terminated by SCP-7938 in Baguio, Philippines. An evacuation was rapidly enacted during initial containment attempts.</p>

<p><strong>Details:</strong> SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B proceeded to verbally berate each other for 49 consecutive hours. Game ceased with no progress made as both player's vocal cords were rendered unable to produce sound.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> An emergency meeting between the Ethics Committee, the Unreality Department, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">O5-12</span><sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-2" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')">2</a></sup> O5-9, Mike Carlsen from the Site-17 Janitorial Staff, and the entire civilian population of Cuba was convened to determine a resolution pertaining to SCP-7938.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-7938-A winning</p>
<p><strong>Termination:</strong> Cannibalism</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> After 17 moves, SCP-7938-A proceeded to assault and disembowel SCP-7938-B over a period of 49 minutes. SCP-7938-A consumed approximately 91.31% of SCP-7938-B's body mass. The remaining 8.69% of SCP-7938-B's person proceeded to reconstruct itself into a functioning brain and skeletal system and resign, prior to exiting the facilities of the match and expiring.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> A bovine in London<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-4" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')">4</a></sup> rapidly assumed the form of SCP-7938-B shortly following the conclusion of the game. A second bovine in close proximity rapidly assumed the form of a business suit that SCP-7938-B promptly adorned.</p>

<p><strong>???:</strong> Round 30 has officially concluded. Both players have already resumed the event and started competing in game number 31.</p>
<p><em>Video plays on screen showing two individuals playing chess. Both individuals have been stripped of their skin<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/javascript:;" target="_blank" id="footnoteref-6" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')">6</a></sup>.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> The game was quiet, with neither player making major mistakes or blunders, resulting in a draw. An in-depth breakdown will proceed later tonight. While the first moves of the 31st round are played, we have been blessed by a brief interview with the organizer of this tournament.</p>
<p><em>The feed cuts to a split-screen containing the original reporter sitting at his desk, and a video of him standing in front of a hotel holding a microphone.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> What exactly inspired you to organize this event?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Well, you know. Every great sport is full of infamous rivalries. Like, the uh… Tennis! Probably. Soccer teams probably hate each other. The point is, rivalries are very popular! So, why not build on some tension?</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> I see. What exactly is your goal with this whole thing?</p>
<p><em>The entity laughs.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> To see a World Chess Championship produce the World Chess Champion. Simple as that. But, we hopefully can generate eyes like the 1972 Championship did.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> A noble goal.</p>
<p><em>A third copy of the same man walks up to the reporter on the desk and whispers into the reporter's ear.</em></p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Reports indicate that the 31st game has concluded in a draw. They state that Korchnoi, after losing his queen, consumed all of the pieces on the board and declared a stalemate. Karpov, unable to interject, agreed to the draw.</p>
<p><strong>???:</strong> Well then, I best get going to organize the 32nd. Hope to be back later!</p>

<p>Greetings. I am Director Lewis Rachels Landoman Richard-Lopez Martin VII of Newcastle.

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Draw</p>
<p><strong>Termination:</strong> Resignation</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> SCP-7938-A resigned prior to the first move.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> A 54-hour break was declared so players could rest. The immediate family of both SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B were teleported in front of them as concrete surrounding both players assumed the form of restraints against them. Both players were subsequently forced to stand in place with both eyes open at their families. All family members present faced anomalous alteration, including the rapid growth of additional limbs, the growth of excess flesh and skin, the transformation of skin into cartilage, incineration, and forced vocalization. After the break concluded, all individuals were installed as a permanent addition to the playing venue. Both players were released and allowed to continue playing games.</p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">I trusted you!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">You can not blame this on me!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">This is all your fault!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">Anatoly, if I knew what would happen I would not tell you to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">Why? Because you really care for others around you, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">If I knew what would happen to my family-</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">Don't you even mention Bela and Igor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">I am not a soulless monster! Just listen to me!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">Give me one good reason why you are not to blame for my family and yours being tortured in that hall!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">I already have. Perhaps you should open your ears and listen to what I have to say!</span></p>

SCP-7938-A utilized his hypnotic beams to cause approximately 50% of SCP-7938-B's army to defect. Over the proceeding 870 moves, 62% of yoga instructors expired prior to both sides agreeing to a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ceasefire</span> temporary pause of fighting.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Thousands weep for their brothers, enemies, and those innocent they may never know that were lost in the war between two rich men over pennies.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Draw</p>
<p><strong>Termination:</strong> Repeated-atomic disintegration</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> A figure grows angrier and angrier as each day goes on that threatens to be the same.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> We are not here. We are not ruling from Tokyo to La Paz. We are not able to pray. We are not dead. We are not alive. We are not stupid. We are not able to resist. We are not able to work in departments. We are not able to secure. We are not able to contain. We are not able to protect. We are not able to express our sorrow. We are not able to speak. We are not able to run. We are not able to rely on the O5, the Committee, the Unreality, the Fire Suppressionists, the five Tau, the Shark Punchers, or the failsafes. We are not the failsafe anymore. We are not in control. We are not in the 5,000. We are not good at chess. We are not what we were.</p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">Anatoly.</span></p>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">That you were just wrong. San Marino was, and still is, a state that I can not live in. Not anymore.</span></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">We were living the best life. Heroes of our nation. Two of the three best chess players in the world, with the third being some American antisemite.</span></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">Then I left my family behind knowing they might not be able to join me. Might not want to join me.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">I can't say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">I felt betrayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">We'd been friends since we were kids. Old kids, but still friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">Best friends. Best friends who went to the movies, who played in tournaments together, who were there for each other's weddings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">National heroes. San Marino was the best at chess, and we were the best chess players in San Marino. Why would anyone give that up?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">I could never understand you. Leaving it all behind, how stupid it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #f5f5f5">I still think it's stupid.</span></p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> SCP-7938-A winning</p>
<p><strong>Termination:</strong> Resignation</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> SCP-7938-A, who held the white pieces, gradually would score a tactical advantage in the Classical Pirc. Though mostly evenly balanced throughout the game, on move 35 SCP-7938-A began to gain the advantage prior to a series of blunders by SCP-7938-B, causing massive material loss. On move 41, seeing no way to recover the position, SCP-7938-B resigned the game, resulting in SCP-7938-A winning the World Chess Championship.</p>
<p><strong>Aftermath:</strong> What happened never happened. We will make sure it never happens again.</p>
</div>
<p>SCP-7938 concluded after 391 years with SCP-7938-A winning 28,544.5 - 28,443.5 against SCP-7938-B.</p>
