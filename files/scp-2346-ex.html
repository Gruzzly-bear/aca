<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Dr. Endicott is to monitor any and all communications, missives or daily events for instances of SCP-2346.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2346 is an anomalous sequence of numbers, "2346" that appears in ~85% of all written material observed by Dr. Endicott. Whether the anomalous sequence was already present, or is inserted when observed by Dr. Endicott is currently unknown — SCP-2346 appears to be the result of a sentient being that targets exclusively Dr. Endicott for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Each time Dr. Endicott observes an instance of SCP-2346, the resulting anomalous effect is of minor negative consequence. If Dr. Endicott fails to notice a new instance of SCP-2346, the resulting anomalous effect has widespread or disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Research into the origins and mechanics behind SCP-2346 are under investigation. A non-comprehensive list of notable SCP-2346 instances is included below:</p>

<h4 id="toc1"><span>NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION</span></h4>
<p>Following Dr. Endicott's suspension, an internal review began due to concerns surrounding the quickly degrading mental state shown in the submitted instances. Dr. Endicott logged a total of 2,346 instances between 07/06/2004-19/05/2005, 1,058 of which were submitted during the three months prior to his suspension. Upon detailed investigation, no causal link was found between the reported instances.</p>
<p>In fact, further investigation revealed a further 13,327 instances of the sequence '2346' in documents related to or created by Dr. Endicott that were neither reported, nor correlated to any anomalous effects. It is the conclusion of both the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Replication Studies that any correlations between '2346' and negative consequences were the direct result of selective perception by Dr. Endicott.</p>
<p>On 03/07/2005, after Dr. Endicott failed to return to work at the conclusion of his suspension, Foundation agents were dispatched to perform a wellness check, accompanied by Site Psychiatrist Dr. Ezra Fisher. A written statement from Dr. Fisher is provided below.</p>
<p>— Maria Jones, Director, RAISA</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>On the 3rd of July, I was dispatched to perform a wellness check on Dr. Endicott, a Foundation researcher, due to concerns of his worsening mental state. Upon our arrival, Dr. Endicott greeted us at the door, appearing disheveled and gaunt. He quickly ushered us in, before shutting the door. I observed as he performed as series of knocks: 2, then 3, then 4, then 6, muttering under his breath as he did.</p>
<p>Dr. Endicott led us into his sitting room, where the walls had been covered with pages of documents, hospital records, overdue bill notices and a variety of unrelated advertisements or flyers. Each one was covered in notation, each instance containing the sequence of numbers '2346'. The room was disorderly, full of piles of trash and takeout. Dr. Endicott sat in a stool, staring at the wall of pages, seemingly ignoring us.</p>
<p>He then stated "You know? It's kinda funny. It's all my fault. But none of you believed that." After asking questions to clarify, Dr. Endicott became distressed, ranting and violently tearing at the pages on the walls. The agents present moved to draw their weapons, but, at my order, stopped and left Dr. Endicott and I alone. I observed Dr. Endicott sink to the floor, gripping a sheet of paper tight in his hands.</p>
<p>I asked Dr. Endicott what he was holding, at which point he stated: "I'm sorry. I killed him. I should have noticed. I should have been more careful. 2,3,4,6. So yeah. I killed him. He didn't trust me. Why didn't Charles trust me anymore? I just. I knew better. The doctors didn't understand. I'm smarter than those brainless doctors. 2,3,4,6. They didn't. Nobody else understood. Charles didn't understand either. It was everywhere, ruining my life. Those numbers. The same sequence. 2346, again and again. Again and again and again just — Never 2,3,4,5. Of course not. That would make sense. 2346 is more clever than that. It hides. In plain sight. Lurking around every corner. But I got distracted, you know? Fuck me. I was worried. Charles was getting worse. I had to get him out. Back home. Away from there. I wasn't thinking straight. I wasn't focused, I wasn't prepared — 2,3,4,6 — I wasn't. I wasn't thinking. I just didn't notice. I know I should have noticed. I didn't. I didn't notice. Should have known better. I didn't notice it, not then."</p>
<p>At that point, Dr. Endicott stopped responding to my questions. After multiple attempts to resume communication between us, Dr. Endicott shook his head, and handed a sheet of paper to me. At this point, he began to repeat the sequence of phrases: "I didn't. I didn't notice. Should have known better. I didn't notice it, not then."</p>
<p>Upon review, the page I was given was a hospital discharge bill, dated 19/05/2005. The total, circled in red was "$23,468.21". It was then I noticed another page on the wall; an autopsy report for one Charles Endicott. It was mostly obscured with Dr. Endicott's writings, but the time of death was encircled in red: 11:46PM.</p>
<p>I asked Dr. Endicott what had happened to Charles, at which point, Dr. Endicott froze. In the only moment of true lucidity that I noted during my visit, he spoke and said: "I wish I had seen the total, maybe then I could have saved Charles. I just… didn't notice.", before returning to his former repetition.</p>
<p>It is plain to see that Dr. Endicott is a man in pain. His obsession with SCP-2346 has taken over his entire life, defining not only how he perceives the world, but also in how he copes. His compulsive behaviors have taken over his entire being, SCP-2346 being integrated in every part of his routine, occupying his entire life. Dr. Endicott is terrified of breaking those rituals; after all, in his mind, that sequence killed his husband. It's tough to make out through his hand writing, but the ME report lists the cause of death as 'heart attack due to comorbidity'. Nothing about the situation was anomalous, and yet, to him, it was real.</p>
<p>At the Foundation, we train our researchers to notice the unnoticeable. We praise those who find the anomalous in the mundane, promote the scientists who overwork themselves, pushing themselves along the delicate balance between greatness and self-destruction. We sacrifice ourselves for the greater good, knowing we have saved thousands more from the same fate.</p>
<p>And yet, looking at Dr. Endicott, I cannot help but doubt things. If our mission is right, is Dr. Endicott an acceptable loss? He is still hurting, haunted by an imaginary specter, a sequence that seems to taunt him wherever he looks. His mental health issues and obsessive compulsive behaviors intensified this, yes, but — could we have done something?</p>
<p>Should we have done something?<br/></p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<p>Dr. Ezra Fisher<br/>
Psychiatry</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Following the submission of the above written statement, further diagnostic sessions and a full internal review, Dr. Endicott was placed into psychiatric care and SCP-2346 was reclassified as SCP-2346-EX.</p>
