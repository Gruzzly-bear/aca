            <h1>SCP-4162</h1>
            <div class='text-content'><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-4162</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Euclid</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> A containment zone has been set up in Foundation-controlled waters off the coast of Mexico in order to prevent SCP-4162 from reaching civilized areas. Two D-Class operatives immobilized via restraints are to be present on small craft, one on each side of the containment zone, in order to serve as bait for SCP-4162 to ensure it does not roam outside of the containment zone. Once SCP-4162 has terminated one of these two personnel and begins targeting the other, the terminated individual is to be replaced immediately.</p>
<p>This cycle is to be repeated indefinitely so as to prevent SCP-4162 from selecting a target located outside the containment zone. Any individuals attempting to approach or pass through the containment zone are to be repelled immediately by on-site marine personnel. In addition, a no-fly zone has been established directly above the containment zone and the immediate surrounding area.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4162 is an intangible ovoid object, red in colouration, three meters tall and one meter wide. Although it possesses no visible means of ambulation, SCP-4162 moves by floating one meter in the air and proceeding linearly in a certain direction. During this process, SCP-4162 mildly pulsates several times a minute; the purpose of this is unknown.</p>
<p>SCP-4162 will constantly move towards the individual designated as its target at a speed slightly faster than that of the target itself. In cases where the target is stationary, SCP-4162 will move as slowly as 0.1 km/h - however, SCP-4162 has also been recorded as reaching speeds as high as 930 km/h on occasions where targets have attempted to escape it via aircraft. It is currently unknown whether this constitutes the maximum speed of SCP-4162. Due to the intangible nature of SCP-4162, there are no known means of slowing or stopping its movement below these boundaries.</p>
<p>Once SCP-4162 enters within one meter of its target, a rapid expansion of air will take place in the target's skull, causing their cranium to violently explode after a period of three to five seconds. SCP-4162 will then immediately designate the nearest human being as its next target, and the process will repeat. Entering within one meter of SCP-4162 holds no ill effects for any individual not currently designated as the target.</p>
<p>SCP-4162 is sapient and, despite possessing no bodily means of doing so, is capable of speaking in a high-pitched voice reminiscent of that of a prepubescent child. Despite its hostile behaviour, SCP-4162 is invariably talkative and friendly when engaged in conversation by any individual, including its current target. (See Interview Logs.)</p>

<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Spencer<br/>
<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-4162</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> This interview and all subsequent ones were conducted via a flying drone equipped with audio transmitting and receiving equipment. The following interview took place while SCP-4162 was moving towards its current target at a speed of 0.1 km/h.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Hello?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Huh? Oh! Hi there, little guy!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Hello. Are you receiving me alright?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Of course I can hear you, what a weird thing to say. What are you supposed to be, anyway? Like, a bird or something?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> No, I'm communicating with you via this drone. It's like … a robot I'm using to talk to you. Do you know what a robot is?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Well, duh. Do I know what a robot is? You're pretty strange, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Oh. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> My name is Dr. Spencer. Is it alright if I ask you some questions?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Well, I've got nothing else to do. What do you wanna ask?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Could you tell me where you came from?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Oh, that's an easy one, I know this. There was a boat a little way back and I came from over there.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Um, no, I mean <em>before</em> that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Before that I was over at this boat I'm heading to now. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> I think I'm not getting myself across properly. Where did you <em>originally</em> come from?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> I have to go now. Let's talk later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Wait - couldn't you just answer my question first?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Bye!</p>
<p><strong>(SCP-4162 refuses to respond further. Interview terminated.)</strong></p>

<strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-4162</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Interview was conducted as SCP-4162 was eliminating its current target, the immobilized D-92812.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Hi!</p>
<p><strong>D-92812:</strong> What the fuck - what the, what the fuck is that?! No, no, no, no, no! Stay the hell away from -</p>

<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Bye!</p>
<p><strong>(SCP-4162 begins moving towards its next target, D-91392, who is located at the other side of the containment zone. SCP-4162 begins humming as the drone approaches.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Hello! Is it alright if I talk to you now?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> (humming)</p>
<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> (volume increased) Hello?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> (yelps)</p>
<p><strong>(Pause. Despite the exclamation of surprise, SCP-4162 makes no unusual movements.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Ah, I apologize if I startled you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Nah, that's fine. I was just coming up with a little tune. There's nothing like a good song! What did you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Why did you kill that man?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Yeah, I killed that guy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Yes, but why?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Um … he's dead now. That's fine. I don't get what you're saying.</p>
<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> I am aware that you killed them. What I am asking you is your reasoning for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> His head blew up. I'm gonna go now, I need to get to the next guy, okay?</p>

<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Interview was conducted as SCP-4162 was approaching its current target, D-91392.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Hello? Yes? I would really like to talk to you, if that's alright.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Hi, Mr. Spencer! What do you wanna talk about? I have a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Do you intend to kill the man you're currently approaching?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Sure am!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Could you … well, could you not?</p>
<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Could you refrain from killing him? Is that something you're <em>able</em> to do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> You're not making any sense. Are you feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> (sighs) I'm not sure how many more ways I can phrase this. Could you refrain from killing your target? Can you <em>not</em> kill him?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> I'm going to blow up his head, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> No!</p>
<p><strong>(Pause.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Okay, listen. You and I have built a rapport, yes?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Is that like a house or something?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> No. It means we - (deep inhale) - it means that we have a good relationship. Would you … is that something you'd agree with?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Yeah, you're my little buddy!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> Say that I was standing there right after you killed your target. What would you do?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> I'd kill you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Spencer:</strong> But why?! Jesus, fuck!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> You need to calm down, okay? I can't talk now, I have to kill this guy. Good to hear from you, though!</p>
<p><strong>(SCP-4162 begins final approach towards D-91392, who catches sight of it.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Hi!</p>
<p><strong>D-91392:</strong> (laughs) Okay, what the hell is this supposed to be? There's, uh, there's a giant egg floating towards me -</p>
<p><strong>(SCP-4162 enters one meter range of D-91392. Three seconds later, his head violently explodes.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>SCP-4162:</strong> Bye!</p>
<p><strong>(SCP-4162 begins moving towards D-39421, who is located at the other side of the containment zone. As SCP-4162 does not respond further when prompted, the interview is terminated. Dr. Spencer is admonished for unprofessional conduct during the interview.)</strong></p>

<p>Fourteen subsequent interviews were conducted with SCP-4162, invariably providing no new information on its origins or intentions. As a result, I would recommend no future attempts be conducted due to the clear waste of resources.</p>
<p>Please, please reassign me. I would really appreciate it.</p>
