<p>Cressona, PA, USA: now designated Site-5076-1.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Law enforcement channels worldwide are to be monitored for clusters of missing persons reports consistent with SCP-5076 activity.</p>
<p>Foundation web crawler Beta-12 ("BANANAPEELER") is to monitor the web for any mention of the phrase '<em>OBOBAN NATION</em>', as well as any related SCP-5076-related keywords.</p>
<p>Upon confirmation of an SCP-5076 event, personnel are to be dispatched immediately according to procedure 'WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE', detailed in Document-5076-O.</p>
<p>All roads leading to Site-5076-1 have been redirected. A cover story detailing a nuclear meltdown having occurred on 1/18/20 has been disseminated, and all former inhabitants of Site-5076-1 legally declared dead. For a complete operational purview of Veil-keeping regarding Site-5076-1, see Document-5076-V-1.</p>
<p>MTF Lambda-8 "Ape Mode" is to be stationed along the perimeter surrounding Site-5076-1. All online activity originating from Site-5076-1 is to be monitored. If Site-5076-1's Veil is at risk due to the online activities of an SCP-5076-A instance, all internet connection to Site-5076-1 is to be cut off for a duration of 5 hours, and the offending SCP-5076-A instance reprimanded.</p>
<p>Entrance to Site-5076-1 outside of a Veil-restoring operation or as a member of the 5076 Cultural Exchange Liaison is forbidden without the express permission of Area-179's director, and a unanimous vote by the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Entities entering or exiting Site-5076-1 without authorization are to be neutralized.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-5076 refers to an anomalous event in which the inhabitants of a moderately sized human population center spontaneously disappear, followed by the appearance of sapient members of the <em>Pongo</em> genus.</p>
<p>As of ██/██/████, SCP-5076 has only occurred once- in Cressona, Pennsylvania- a northeastern borough formerly holding a human population of around 1500. Cressona has since been designated Site-5076-1.</p>
<p>The orangutan specimens inhabiting Site-5076-1- labeled SCP-5076-A, demonstrate intelligence and vocal capabilities comparable to humans as well as a ██-class technological proficiency. Human art, religion, and culture seem to be major topics of interest to SCP-5076-A.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of their appearance at Site-5076-1, SCP-5076-A claims regarding the history and culture of their species cannot be verified. Notable claims include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SCP-5076-A vocalize using a 'universal communication field', and are capable of speech with any biological life</li>
<li>SCP-5076-A have no connection to non-anomalous members of the <em>Pongo</em> genus existing on earth- referring to them as 'crude effigies'</li>
<li>SCP-5076-A are a race of inter-dimensional nomads known as the <em>Obobans</em></li>
<li>SCP-5076-A have existed long before humanity</li>
</ul>
<p>SCP-5076-A have constructed what appears to be a religious shrine at the center of Site-5076-1; a random assortment of machinery- including wires, cables, automobile and computing components- arranged and modified in a way that serves no apparent purpose or function. All SCP-5076-A instances have been observed to gather around this structure at 20:00 daily, appearing to meditate as a group for hours on end. SCP-5076-A have refused to disclose the meaning of this ritual.</p>
<p>A number of religious artifacts written in an unknown language have been recovered from Site-5076-1- seemingly having materialized alongside SCP-5076-A- partly validating claims regarding a history. A translation of these texts- made possible through the assistance of orangutan priests- is pending.</p>
<p>In order to gain a more holistic understanding of <em>Oboban</em> society and beliefs, the 5076 Cultural Liaison was established. For documentation of information gained through this program, see files under 5076-CL-EP. As this exchange is still underway, 5076-CL-EP files will be updated routinely.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5076.1:</strong> Discovery<br/>
<span style="font-size:0%;">@</span><br/>
On 1/18/2020, a staggering amount of emergency calls- mostly regarding missing persons from Cressona, Pennsylvania- came to the Foundation's attention. A large-scale amnestics program was enacted, and the perimeter surrounding Site-5076-1 was secured. A misinformation campaign regarding a nuclear meltdown was disseminated into media and law enforcement channels.</p>
<p>Hours later, a website operating under the name '<em>OBOBAN NATION</em>' was discovered, hosted from servers in Cressona. The entire website, sans the title, was written in an unknown text. The page depicted images and videos of SCP-5076-A instances engaging in routine activities at Site-5076-1. Scenes depicted <em>Oboban</em> families caring for their offspring, a recording depicting a ritual revolving around the site's makeshift shrine, and a recorded message from SCP-5076-A-402- the apparent leader of <em>Oboban</em> society, addressing the viewer in what is assumed to be the same language the website was written in. Notably, SCP-5076-A-402 does not resemble an adult orangutan.</p>
<p>'<em>OBOBAN NATION</em>' was put under immediate digital quarantine.</p>
<p><strong>Addendum 5076.2:</strong> Engagement Log Transcripts</p>
<p>Engagement of SCP-5076-A occurred on 5/19/2020. Because of his experience with dangerous anomalies, as well as his [DATA EXPUNGED], Area-179 senior researcher Dr. Edward Dune was chosen to initiate contact with SCP-5076-A. Researcher Angela Starse kept in contact with Dune via radio.</p>
<p>A body camera was attached to Dr. Dune's person for documentation purposes. Transcripts of the engagement mission are listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Uh, just a second.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dr. Dune walks outside of the office doors&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Who the fuck do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Edward, I can't believe I'm hearing this from you. The man who would curse out an O5 if they spilled his coffee is suddenly worried about the chain of command?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> We can't just let them stay! We don't even-</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Why not? Why the hell not, Edward?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> We don't understand them-</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Were you even paying attention in there? I will not allow genocide, doctor. I don't care where on the hierarchy I fall. Tell them that they're safe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Ang, I just don't know if I can promise that. God, I don't want to have to tell them that they need to leave, but-</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Cold, not cruel, Edward. Isn't that what you used to tell me? Can't we do something good for once?</p>
<p><em>&lt;pause&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> <em>&lt;exhaling&gt;</em> You're right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Besides, when was the last time I got reprimanded for anything, eh?</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dune reenters the office&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> We'll help you guys out-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> Thank you!</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-5076-A-299 embraces Dune, who stumbles backward&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Okay, okay! Get off!</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dune pushes SCP-5076-A-299 off&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Alright, listen. I don't know how, or in what way- but we're not going to chase you guys away. I'll tell you this though, if you're staying- you're going to be seeing quite a bit of us.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> That's understandable, doctor. Our people thank you.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> Hold it right there.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> <em>Gabo'an</em>!</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> Quiet. I'm not going to deal with all of <em>&lt;gesturing&gt;</em> this!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> Please, doctor- he-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> This whole lock down, containment thing. How do I put it? Uh- we like your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> If we're staying, we get the internet back.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> You're fucking with me.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> Oh, I'm very serious, doctor. I'm not spending six months doing nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Now this is beyond my jurisdiction. Angela, you see what happens when you give an inch?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Uh, it'd certainly be a security issue without precautions-</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> <em>Gabo'an</em>, this is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> I'm not just going to sit here!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Yeah, I'm leaving. You can deal with this one, Ang.</p>

<p><strong>Preliminary Notes:</strong> Per request, Senior Researcher Angelina Starse was tasked with entering Site-5076-1 and negotiating with the SCP-5076-A instances, as well as retrieving Dr. Dune after his moderately hostile encounter with the <em>Oboban</em> leadership. As the threat to Dr. Dune's life was perceived as low, Starse entered Site-5076-1 without any accompaniment.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Begin Recording&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>Extraneous dialogue removed. Starse makes her way to the borough hall, which is guarded by various SCP-5076-A instances. After conversing with the duo of guards at the door, she makes her way into the main office, where SCP-5076-A-402 sits at his desk, fixated on a hand-held video game device. SCP-5076-A-299 is present. Starse kneels.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Sir.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> Your formality is appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Thank you. <em>Bo'naub</em>, right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Okay, my name is Angelina, and I'm with the Foundation. I apologize for the, uh, boldness of my colleague- but we're willing to help your people, as long as you can comply with a few regulations we have in place.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> That's fine and dandy, Ang- as long as those regulations don't cut off our internet access.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> For recreational purposes?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> <em>Bo'naub</em>?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> I cannot go against the wishes of his excellency, as much as I may disagree with them.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> Look, if we're going to stay here, we need something to do. We just want to play a couple games here and there, nothing major.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Sir, I can't guarantee anything at the moment- but I'm sure we can find a compromise. An isolated network might be a possibility, but as it stands- nothing will get done without compliance on your part as well. Do you see what I'm getting at?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> You want your friend back.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> That would be a start.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> He's in there. <em>&lt;gesturing towards a closet&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Starse appears to hold back laughter&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> May I retrieve him?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> It doesn't matter to me, he's an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> That may be true.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Starse opens the closet. Dune sits on a box, arms crossed and visibly agitated.&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Edward.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> Shut up.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Dune leaves the closet. Starse pulls a chair in front of the desk where SCP-5076-A-402 sits.</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> We're willing to help your people, your excellency. You have a clear interest in our culture, and we'd be happy to oblige. Of course, we'd have to make things official, but a cultural liaison, internet access, and protection are definitely in the cards. Does that sound about right?</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> And what would your Foundation expect from us?</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Only information. We'd like to study your culture, with your assistance, of course.</p>
<p><em>&lt;SCP-5076-A-299 is visibly uncomfortable&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> I would oversee the committee. You would be safe, I can assure that.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-402:</strong> It's fine by me. <em>Bo'naub</em>, you said the other Foundations barely communicated.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Dune:</strong> I want nothing to do with this, Ang.</p>
<p><strong>SCP-5076-A-299:</strong> We accept your concessions.</p>
<p><strong>Researcher Starse:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p><em>&lt;Starse discusses the logistics and planning of a cultural liaison, as well as various other topics with the SCP-5076-A leadership. Over the duration of the 3 hour conversation, Dune paces himself throughout the room.

<hr/>
<p>Hey Ang, just read over the file- everything seems to be in order. I corrected a few SPaG errors. Nothing major, really- except, oh- it seems that you've misspelled orangutan in every goddamn instance of the word.</p>
<p>36! 36 fucking times you used the word 'orangutang'. 36 times I had to correct a middle-school level mistake in what's going to be an official Foundation document. What the hell, Ang? Just because you're hanging around a bunch of primates doesn't give you the excuse to start spelling like one. Get your shit together.</p>
<p>Anyways, I had another question: why are you writing as if this wasn't just a one-time thing? SCP-5076 should be designated Cressona, not the event of monkeys appearing out of thin air, yeah? It's ultimately your call, but it's something to consider. I doubt Roman's going to approve of those conprocs just because there's a <em>slight</em> chance it'll happen again. Maybe I'm missing something, though. It's late. Get back to me soon.</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
Dr. Edward T. Dune, Senior Researcher, Area-179</p>

<p>Edward, it was a spelling error. This is why you're a frequent topic of discussion for Site Administration.</p>
<p>Onto business- yes, you have every right to question my judgement on the SCP-5076 denotation. In fact, I was midway through the first draft when I got news from the Liaison team. Those translations they were working on with <em>Bo'naub</em> are done. He was reluctant to translate this particular book, but felt he was 'doing the right thing'- apparently against the wishes of <em>Gabo'an</em>.</p>
<p>I took a look at them, and- well, I think it's best for you to see for yourself.</p>
<p>Pet theory: that thing they're building in the center of town? It's not a shrine. It's a communications tower, and every night they're sending a distress signal to whatever is left of their race.</p>
<p>I've attached the addendum below. You'll see what I mean. We should be cautious, Edward.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what we've gotten ourselves into.</p>
<p>Best Wishes,<br/>
Angelina Starse, Senior Researcher, Area-179</p>

<p><strong>Addendum 5076.3:</strong> Recovered and Translated Artifact from Site-5076-1<br/>
The following is a translated portion from the SCP-5076-A religious text- <em>On Creation, and its End</em>- supposedly written by a great Oboban prophet-king, foretelling the 'death of life', and the last days of SCP-5076-A society:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We, great Progenitors of Life,</em><br/>
<em>Universe, sing to us</em><br/>
<em>Our Creations bear Creations,</em><br/>
<em>Images of us</em><br/>
<em>Eons, this will be so</em><br/>
<em>I say, this will be so</em><br/>
<em>All 13 Houses of Bo-Too'a</em><br/>
<em>United, creating, traveling</em><br/>
<em>We, nomad Gods of Life</em><br/>
<em>Creations, vast and without end</em><br/>
<em>Will one day fall</em><br/>
<em>In the Millennia of the Damned</em><br/>
<em>He will come</em><br/>
<em>The Tribes Shall Be Split</em><br/>
<em>on the Black Night of His arrival</em><br/>
<em>Our Canvas shall cry out and soon be silenced</em><br/>
<em>By the Jaws of His Presence</em><br/>
<em>We shall run, endlessly throughout our Creation</em><br/>
<em>He will pursue</em><br/>
<em>We will scatter, to the depths and cracks of Our Canvas</em><br/>
<em>Each time, He will find us</em><br/>
<em>Brothers and Sisters lost, awaiting contact</em><br/>
<em>He has already found them</em><br/>
<em>Wherever our House be built</em><br/>
<em>He will dismantle it</em><br/>
<em>I say to you, listen</em><br/>
<em>His coming is swift- His pursuit endless</em><br/>
<em>Dread Devourer of Stars, He is inescapable</em><br/>
<em>The Prison of Glass cannot stand</em><br/>
<em>The Chains of String cannot hold</em><br/>
<em>The Blaspheme of Order cannot continue</em><br/>
<em>Wherever we roam</em><br/>
<em>The Death of Life follows</em></p>
