<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> There is no way to really contain</span> SCP-8448<span style="color: blue">, as it’s primarily in Ilya’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">Well, there is. But that’s for him to discover.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Description:</strong></span> SCP-8448 <span style="color: blue">is a series of lucid dreams (so far only one, but there will be more) that Researcher Ilya Vavilov has had and will have.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">Below I have left a transcript of the dream from Ilya’s point of view:</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya wakes up. He looks around, seeing that he is in a forest. The sunset is very beautiful. He notices that the world around him is a mix of real and cartoon. He doesn't know what he looks like in this world, though. The forest has no mirrors.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya (internally):</strong> <em>I’m outside. I don’t remember leaving the house.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya stands up. He pats his pockets. Inside the right pocket, is a small rock.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Hm.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya begins to walk. He walks for a while. They eventually reach the end, walking into a neighborhood.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness is waiting for him.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Hi, Ilya.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The hollowness is strange. It is humanoid. It has a cartoon head with one cartoon eye and one real eye. It has a Venus flytrap plants for hands, and two Venus flytraps on its shoulders. It’s wearing a weird sweatshirt with a mouth on it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Note: This is where I thought an image might be helpful.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Who are you?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> The Hollowness.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> I want you to have something.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness closes its weird plant palm.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Open your hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya hesitates. They open their palm.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness puts its hand over Ilya’s. It opens its hand, then removes it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya looks at what he is holding. It is the mouth of a Venus fly trap.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Why did you give this to me?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness blinks.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya (internally):</strong> <em>This is weird. I’ve never had a dream like this. I know I’m dreaming. I feel like I’m gonna wake up soon. But I still have so many questions.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>A batch of rocks appears on the ground.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya (internally):</strong> <em>Huh? Okay. Dreams aren't known for their logic.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> I will see you again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Uh, okay.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Addendum 1:</strong></p>
<p>After the discovery of this document, Researcher Ilya Vavilov was questioned about the contents of his dream. He revealed that when he awoke, he had a small rock and mouth of a Venus fly trap in his pocket. When asked if the telling of this dream was accurate, Researcher Vavilov confirmed that the contents of the document were accurate to the dream that he had.</p>
<p>Foundation staff attempted to delete the SCiP account “the_hollowness”. The account reinstated itself within minutes of deletion. Staff have attempted contact with the account. Currently, there has been no reply.</p>
<p>Creation of a proper SCP file for SCP-8448 was decided to be postponed until more about the anomaly was discovered. However, the entity "The Hollowness" has been tentatively designated SCP-8448-1.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that Researcher Vavilov <span style="color: blue">DATA EXPUNGED. There is a right is a time for everything.</span></p>
<p>This document is to be monitored for further changes.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya wakes up in a forest.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Goddamnit. Not this again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya stands up. They begin to walk around.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Hey, weird dream thing, you here?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya's voice echos throughout the forest.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya has been walking through the forest for a while.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Jeez. Last time I entered the neighborhood by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya encounters a group of Venus fly traps. They all have eyes on them. The eyes look as if they are hardly attached to the plants.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> What the fuck…?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Venus flytraps blink at Ilya.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> …Freaky. Uh, I'm just gonna leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya turns to leave.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Venusfly traps begin to speak.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Venus Flytrap:</strong> Are you sure?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Uh… what?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya turns back to face the Venus flytraps.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Another Venus Flytrap:</strong> Are you okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya says nothing.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Another Venus Flytrap:</strong> You'll lose sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya puts their hand over the patch of fabric on their face that covered where his left eye used to be. He opens his mouth to speak. They are no longer in the forest. He is in the neighborhood again.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness is waiting for him.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Hello, Ilya.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Would you like to explain what's going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness is holding SCP-2295 in its arms.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> What now?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Is this bear significant to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> <em>He scoffs</em> It's well known knowledge I used Kairos to patch up random scrapes and cuts. And the eye I lost to an infection as a kid. People call me "Researcher Patches".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Who are you trying to tell that too? We both already know that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> That's what I was—</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> I know that it's the narrative you believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> What?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> What is it that this bear is capable of?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Uh, it patches up wounds and scratches and stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> … Is that what it is?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> … Yeah? <em>he pauses</em> At least, I think.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Would you look at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Hey I'm not finished—</span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 2:</strong></p>
<p>It is to be noted that any alterations made by SCP-8448-1 are unable to be edited or removed.</p>
<p>Site-678 somnologist Dr. Hanna Walker suggested that Researcher Vavilov be monitored he while is asleep in order to assess any possible anomalous affects that manifest during or afterwards. Researcher Vavilov agreed.</p>
<p>Researcher Vavilov is to be monitored while asleep within Site-678 sleep laboratory until further notice. Potential usage of OiVM5<sup class="footnoteref"><a class="footnoteref" href="javascript:;" id="footnoteref-1" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup> is pending.</p>
<div style="border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e1f7fa; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<p><em>Due to these recent events, I have decided to allow Researcher to take a payed leave under the condition that we continue to monitor him and future instances of SCP-8448. Researcher Vavilov is to be offered access to counseling from an onsite psychologist if he so desires. - Director Miley Sears</em></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> This is different.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya looks around. The containment cell appears to be a greenhouse. He digs his feet into the dirt on the floor.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Wherever you are, you can probably hear me. I'm getting kind of tired of this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>A patch of Venus flytraps appear in the dirt.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> What the hell is this with all the damn Venus flytraps?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>One of the Venus flytraps opens its mouth, a small rock falling out. It emits a sound that cannot be heard.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya shivers.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya (internally):</strong> <em>I feel uncomfortable all of a sudden. I can't… describe it.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya turns away from the patch of Venus flytraps.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya (internally):</strong> <em>I feel like I can't even look at them.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya rolls up their coat sleeve. They look at the green patchwork on their arm.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> I feel all too aware of my heartbeat. I felt I had to catch my breath. I can't… describe it that well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> What do you think of this room?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> <em>shrugs</em> It's a greenhouse. I don't really work with plants much.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness disappears.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 3:</strong></p>
<p>It has been observed that the SCP-8448 file only updates while Researcher Vavilov is asleep.</p>
<p>After the events of this dream, Researcher Vavilov reported feeling uneasy at the thought of Venus flytraps. This is hypothesized to be because <span style="color: blue">[DATA EXPUNGED]. He will learn in due time. They have access to this, remember.</span></p>
<p>Researcher Vavilov put in a maintenance request to fix the AC in his office. This request is being considered.</p>
<div class="material-box">
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Date:</strong> 08/31/2022</span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya wakes up in the same containment cell as last time. Although this time, there are no Venus flytraps.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> God damnit. I- I do <em>not</em> want to see another fucking Venus flytrap.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Hollowness manifests in front of him.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya gasps as he lays his eyes on the Venus flytraps on The Hollowness' shoulders and hands. He quickly turns away.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> You came pretty fast this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> What do the Venus flytraps make you feel?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> … Bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>The Venus flytraps on The Hollowness' shoulders begin to speak.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Shoulder Venus Flytrap One:</strong> Could you be more descriptive?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Like- Something bad's gonna happen if they're here. My instinct is to fuckin'- avoid them. At all costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya begins to hyperventilate.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Can you please make those things go away?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Shoulder Venus Flytrap Two:</strong> Don't move!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya looks at the Venus flytrap slowly. He says nothing.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya realizes that this Venus flytrap sounds like one of his coworkers.</em></span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><em>A small rock falls out of the wound.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya gasps, sucking in breath through his teeth. They quickly move the hair over their lack of an eye and feel their face, checking if the patch of fabric was still on his face. It is still there.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Although they can feel the blood flowing beneath.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> What the hell?! What is this? Why is this here? Why does it hurt?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>It does not hurt physically.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 4:</strong></p>
<p>The SCP-8448 research team attempted to allow Dr. Walker to enter Researcher Vavilov's dream using the OiVM5. This resulted in Dr. Walker awaking immediately after.</p>
<p>Researcher Vavilov awoke following the final line. Within thirty seconds, they began to hyperventilate.</p>
<p>Researcher Vavilov has been observed beginning to stay awake later than usual. Additionally, he has reported observing a "faintly metallic" smell sporadically throughout the day.</p>
<p>Researcher Vavilov has begun to attend weekly therapy with Site Psychologist David Logan. Dr. Logan questioned if the SCP-8448 instances have begun to interfere with his productivity, making note of Researcher Vavilov's newfound paranoia and drowsiness. These symptoms were reported by Dr. Walker. Researcher Vavilov denied any notable affect on his work ethic.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya wakes up in the forest. They open their eyes, letting out an exasperated sigh.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Can we please just be done with this?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> There is still a lot to learn, I've said.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> So this fuckin' shit- this is just <em>a little</em> of it?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Tell me how you've been feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> Not great.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya is quiet for a moment.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> You seem to like to show me things that make me feel worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> You misunderstand me, Ilya. Can you go into detail what you mean by "not great"?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> <em>shrugs</em> I'm just… tired.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Not until sleeping until 3am every night for a week will make you tired.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>Ilya:</strong> No. I'm not tired because of that- I mean, I am. But, that's not what I mean. <em>sighs</em> I'm tired of fearing what I'll face when I fall asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><strong>The Hollowness:</strong> Is this feeling familiar to you?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue"><em>Ilya puts his head in his hands.</em></span></p>

<p><strong>Addendum 5:</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of Researcher Vavilov's mental health, the SCP-8448 research team attempted to restrict his access to the document. Researcher Vavilov's access was reinstated within minutes.</p>
<p>It has been observed that Researcher Vavilov's productivity has began to decline. While he was been contributing to the research for his currently assigned projects, due to the majority of the work being done under duress, his coworkers have had to follow up and correct aspects of his documentation. The SCP-8448 research team will continue to observe Researcher Vavilov and SCP-8448.</p>
<p>Researcher Vavilov has reported feeling "something wet" under his clothes, with nothing present when he checks. Therapy sessions with Dr. David Logan has been increased to twice weekly.</p>

<p><span style="color: blue">I thought that this was quite amusing. So I'll let this stay, albeit crossed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">As it is inaccurate, or unneeded.</span></p>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-8448</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Pending</span> <span style="color: blue">So obsessed with the semantics.</span></p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Currently, there is no way to contain SCP-8448. Researcher Ilya Vavilov is to remain within Site-678's sleep laboratory, Room-2. He has been requested to refrain from leaving the premises without consulting a staff member on duty. Researcher Vavilov has been receptive to these restrictions as of current. If his cooperation with these restrictions comes into question, further discussion is to be had.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">Ilya stays in the boring sleep lab because you asked him to. That's a very complex way of saying that. Very official.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Any objects manifested by SCP-8448-1 within reality are to be confiscated.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">I've only done that a couple of times. Is there really a need to have a protocol for it?</span></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-8448 refers to a series of currently ongoing lucid dreams had by Researcher Ilya Vavilov, an entomologist within Site-678. Currently, little is known about SCP-8448 and SCP-8448-1.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">SCP-8448-1 refers to an entity self labeled "The Hollowness". SCP-8448-1 is capable of manipulating SCP-8448 and to an extent, baseline reality. It's anomalous attributes have been observed as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The ability to manifest objects from SCP-8448 into baseline reality</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The ability to create, edit, and restrict edits on SCP-8448's documentation file</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The ability to reinstate access to SCP-8448's documentation file to individuals who previously had their access removed</span> <span style="color: blue">This one is particularly funny to me. You mean Ilya. Just Ilya.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Despite SCP-8448-1 possessing a SCiPnet account titled "the_hollowness", efforts to directly communicate with it have been deemed unsuccessful. SCP-8448-1 has been observed to "talk" indirectly to the SCP-8448 research team with comments that it leaves on the SCP-8448 documentation file it created. SCP-8448-1 has been observed to only manipulate reality while Researcher Vavilov is asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The full extent of SCP-8448 and SCP-8448-1's anomalous properties are currently unknown. Due to the effect that the anomaly has had on Researcher Vavilov, further discussion regarding solutions are pending. Usage of amnestic treatment to remove memories of SCP-8448 are being discussed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: blue">You're not giving him that poison again.</span></p>

<p><em>The following document was the SCP-8448 research team's attempt at creating a separate, official documentation file for SCP-8448. As you can see, it was unsuccessful. SCP-8448-1 has been showing itself as an unpredictable reality bender capable of manipulating Foundation documents despite attempts to restrict access. I think we should question Researcher Vavilov regarding SCP-8448-1, and gather if he has any ability to stop it. This entire thing has expanded Foundation resources and spent valuable time that could have been spent elsewhere. It is not safe to have an unpredictable entity capable of accessing the Foundation database and adjusting security access at will. - Dr. Hanna Walker</em></p>

<p>Researcher Vavilov was discovered asleep at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon. It is to be noted that merely minutes beforehand, he was observed alert and awake. Initial attempts to awake Researcher Vavilov proved unsuccessful. Dr. Hanna Walker quickly approved of usage of stimulants in order to awaken Researcher Vavilov.</p>
<p>Researcher Vavilov requested access to leave the observation room. Access was denied.</p>
<p>Immediately following this incident, Researcher Vavilov was interviewed by Dr. Walker in an attempt to gauge his knowledge on SCP-8448-1, and if he has any inherent control over its abilities. He claimed to know nothing regarding its reality altering capabilities.</p>

<p><em>All staff at Site-678 have been begun to attend weekly mandated therapy sessions in order to ease the symptoms of PTSD experienced by all personnel affected by the incident. Avenues are being explored for alternative ways to help site staff, however, due to the origin of this anomaly, all use of Amnestics has been banned site-wide, by unanimous vote of all staff.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, Researcher Ilya Vavilov has been transferred to Site-703. They were given a psychological screening, and a subsequent medication and therapy plan was established.</em></p>
<p><em>Researcher Vavilov has reported that he has not experienced SCP-8448 or SCP-8448-1 since the incident.</em></p>
